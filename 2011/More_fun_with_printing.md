I doubt CUPS and I will ever become friends. Every time I try to print
something at home, my notebook has new issues. This time the HP color laser had
jobs stuck at "pending".

Fix this time: re-run hp-setup to add a new printer definition. In the gimp
print dialog a new tab for "color" will appear. Thanks zobel for the
suggestion.
