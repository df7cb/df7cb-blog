My ASUS Transformer TF101 had suddenly started flickering in all sorts of funny
colors some weeks ago. As tapping it gently on the table in the right angle made
the problem go away temporarily, it was clear the problem was about a loose
cable, or some other hardware connection issue.

As I needed to go on a business trip the other day, I didn't look up the
warranty expiration day until later that week. Then, Murphy struck: the tablet
was now 2 years + 1 day old! Calling ASUS, some friendly guy there suggested I
still tried to get ASUS to accept it for warranty, because the tablet had been
with them last year for 5 days, so if they added that, it would still be within
the warranty period. I filled out the RMA form, but one hour later the reply was
they rejected it because it was out of warranty. Another guy on the phone then
said they would probably only do the adding if it had been with them for maybe
10 days, or actually really 30 days, or whatever.

Some googling suggested that the loose cable theory was indeed worth a try, so I
took <a

Putting the case back together was actually harder than disassembling it because
some plastic bits got stuck, but now everything is back to normal.
