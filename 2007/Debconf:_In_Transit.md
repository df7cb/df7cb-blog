Given the steady stream of "are you here yet?" questions in my irc client, it
looks like I will meet a lot of old and new friends in EDI.

My flight will leave from DTM <a href="http://www.flughafen-dortmund.de/index.php?id=63&L=0&flugnummer=EZY%204975&Stadt=&ToFrom=TO">at 17:30 today</a>, arriving at 18:15 in EDI. Still pondering if going by train or car, probably the former.
