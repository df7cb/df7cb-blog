Following a mail from <a href="http://becky.bridgeblogging.com/">Becky Young</a>
I've updated bridgeblogging.com's URL and added about a dozen links to their
individual blog feeds. The subscription list on
<a href="http://bridge.df7cb.de/">bridge.df7cb.de</a> has some 50 entries now.
If your bridge (or bridge-related) blog is not included here, please drop me a
mail. I've added their <a href="http://masteringbridge.com/wordpress" title="Mastering Bridge Blog">Mastering Bridge Blog</a> for beginners,
and <a href="http://dealreleasenews.blogspot.com/" title="Deal Release News">Thomas Andrews' deal</a>
release blog, I hope the technical content doesn't disturb the otherwise
"human" blogs too much.

On real-life bridge notes, I played my first German nationals last weekend. We
finished 61st out of 94 pairs with 47.65% - could have been better, but given
the number of tricks I wasted with bad defense, I'm not really unhappy. Smirnov
- Piekarek won the first two sets by a comfortable margin, but 60.1% in the
third set weren't enough as Elinescu - Wladow scored 73.1% there and finished
first with 66.05%.

As 90 boards in two days aren't enough, we spent Sunday evening with another 32
boards to finish this year's round of league games. Our team did win all
matches (this one 19:11 VP), but we are still only second in the overall
scores.
