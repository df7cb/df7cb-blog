After a bit over half a year of having moved, I finally took the opportunity to play
real-life Bridge here. Thanks to BBO, a partner was found surprisingly fast,
and even we knew each other from the juniors bridge camp at Rieneck, but we
were unsure who actually the other one was from the folks there. So, the
evening started with a friendly "Oh, you are Christoph :)" at the entrance.

Bridge-wise the event wasn't very spectacular, just a teams tourney with the
average club players (though of course a teams event in the evening pushes up
the level a bit). We agreed on some 5M system, and the only real
misunderstanding was after opps had opened 2♥ (both M), 2♠ from Pd (no
agreement), ppp, which lead to a glorious 4-1 fit, and -150, but that didn't
cost much (if at all).

We had the feeling we started well, and reached the final round, but then lost
the remaining matches. To the great surprise of the whole team, we still won.
Of the 4 teams in the final round, VPs were distributed 46-46-46-42, with the
46s all 1:1 against each other, and it was us who had the better carry-over
from the first round. Thanks to Uschi for the good Bridge start here :)
