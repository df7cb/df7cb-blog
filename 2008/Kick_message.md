While wondering how kick messages look on the client side and if they are
actually visible in the sense of not being cluttered with other crap around,
here's one way how **not** to test this:

<pre>
23:56 [testnet] !larich Myon is setting God mode
23:56 [testnet] !larich Myon is using God mode: to evade KICK from Myon: #test Myon boo
</pre>

[[!tag irc]]
