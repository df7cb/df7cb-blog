*(Advertisment)*

I have several packages to give away:

 * endeavour - file and disk management suite
 * avscan - GTK frontend for the Clam AntiVirus scanner (ClamAV)
 * cryopid - Dumps a process into a self-executing file
 * xar - eXtensible ARchiver
 * minimalist - MINImalistic MAiling LISTs manager
 * dtmfdial - DTMF Tone Dialer

If you are interested in taking any of these, please contact me.

The first three have open RC-bugs that need some attention, they have been
orphaned for some weeks, with no takers. endeavour and avscan are already on
the way to RM, if you are interested in these, speak up *now*.

Thanks :)
