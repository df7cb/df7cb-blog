I have just released version 0.11 of
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/tenace/">Tenace</a>,
my bridge hand viewer/editor for Linux/Unix (and Windows, if you have Gtk
installed and get it compiled).

The new "Open in web" feature will send the current hand to bridgebase online's
handviewer to share with other on the web. The parallelized parscore
computation (if you have multiple CPUs) has been improved, thanks to Bo's work
on <a href="http://privat.bahnhof.se/wb758135/">making DDS multi-threaded</a>.

Updated Debian package are on the way to the mirrors, the source code is on the
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/tenace/">Tenace homepage</a>,
