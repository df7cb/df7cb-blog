I knew it was about this time of the year 10 years ago when my Debian account
was created, but I couldn't remember the exact date until I looked it up
earlier this evening: today :). Rene Engelhard had been my advocate, and Marc
Brockschmidt my AM. Thanks guys!

A lot of time has passed since then, and I've worked in various parts of the
project. I became an application manager almost immediately, and quickly got
into the NM front desk as well, revamping parts of the NM process which had
become pretty bureaucratic (I think we are now, 10 years later, back where we
should be, thanks to almost all of the paperwork being automated, thanks
Enrico!). I've processed 37 NMs, most of them between 2005 and 2008, later I
was only active as front desk and eventually Debian account manager. I've
recently picked up AMing again, which I still find quite refreshing as the AM
will always also learn new things.

Quality Assurance was and is the other big field. Starting by doing QA uploads
of orphaned packages, I attended some QA meetings around Germany, and picked up
maintenance of the DDPO pages, which I still maintain. The link between QA and
NM is the MIA team where I was active for some years until they kindly kicked
me out because I was MIA there myself. I'm glad they are still using some of
the scripts I was writing to automate some things.

My favorite MUA is mutt, of which I became co-maintainer in 2007, and later
maintainer. I'm still listed in the uploaders field, but admittedly I haven't
really done anything there lately.

Also in 2007 I started working at credativ, after having been a research
assistant at the university, which meant making my Debian work professional. Of
course it also meant more real work and less time for the hobby part, but I was
still very active around that time. Later in 2010 I was marrying, and we got
two kids, at which point family was of course much more important, so my Debian
involvement dropped to a minimum. (Mostly lurking on IRC ;)

Being a PostgreSQL consultant at work, it was natural to start looking into the
packaging, so I started submitting patches to postgresql-common in 2011, and
became a co-maintainer in 2012. Since then, I've mostly been working on
PostgreSQL-related packages, of which far too many have my (co-)maintainer
stamp on them. To link the Debian and PostgreSQL worlds together, we started an
external repository (apt.postgresql.org) that contains packages for the
PostgreSQL major releases that Debian doesn't ship. Most of my open source time
at the moment is spent on getting all PostgreSQL packages in shape for Debian
and this repository.

According to minechangelogs, currently 844 changelog entries in Debian mention
my name, or were authored by me. Scrolling back yields memories of packages
that are long gone again from unstable, or I passed on to other maintainers.
There are way too many people in Debian that I enjoy(ed) working with to list
them here, and many of them are my friends. Debian is really the extended
family on the internet. My last DebConf before this year had been in Mar del
Plata - I had met some people at other conferences like FOSDEM, but meeting
(almost) everyone again in Heidelberg was very nice. I even remembered all
basic Mao rules :D.

So, thanks to everyone out there for making Debian such a wonderful place to
be!
