I'm a fan of LC\_MESSAGES=de\_DE and localized web pages -- almost.
Unfortunately, the wording of many translations in Debian often drives me nuts.
This applies mostly to web pages and package descriptions. Apologies to all
hard-working translators -- the percentage of good translations does not
outweigh the "wtf" cases for me. Still, I didn't want to switch to English for
all the web.

Rhonda pointed me to a Firefox ^W Iceweasel plugin:
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11327/">HeaderControl</a>.
Now *.debian.org is English for me (reading the constitution in German doesn't
solve DAM problems anyway). Yay!
