Today, I was accepted as <a href="http://www.oftc.net/oftc/Network_Representative">OFTC
network representative</a>. Basically this means I'm now officially supposed to
behave on IRC ;-)

<p> More seriously, I'll try to make the network a better place by helping the
<a href="http://www.oftc.net/oftc/Staff">OFTC staff</a> answer user requests,
mostly on the main #oftc channel and various #debian* channels.
