For years, the Xmas contest has virtually been my only ham radio activity. This
year, after I had to take down the antenna in my parents' yard, I put up the
40m part of a 80/40m dipole in the attic of my flat in Saarbrücken. The first
tests were satisfying so I drove back to Saarbrücken for December 26th.

<p>
The contest started nice with a S9+50 signal from DR5S - of course DOK Q10
meant it was just very close. Unfortunately, things turned out much worse. The
antenna wasn't as matched as I had hoped and I had to put my small MFJ tuner
in. But, whatever I would tune to, the 1:1 would only withstand some second of
transmission and I had to retune. The 1:1 there would pop back up, and I had to
retune back to the original settings. GOTO 10.

<p>
After a bit more than one hour I gave up. The final log is here:

<table>
<tr><td>8.33</td><td>3.543</td><td>DR5S</td><td>599 Q02</td><td>599 Q10</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.42</td><td>7.016</td><td>DL0CS</td><td>599 Q02</td><td>599 M15</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.43</td><td>7.016</td><td>G4OGD</td><td>599 Q02</td><td>599 004</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.50</td><td>7.013</td><td>OK5MM</td><td>599 Q02</td><td>599 019</td></tr>
<tr><td>9.38</td><td>3.545</td><td>DK9IP</td><td>599 Q02</td><td>599 A24</td></tr>
</table>

I don't know where the fault was, in the TRX, the tuner, or the antenna. I hope
it is not the TRX.
