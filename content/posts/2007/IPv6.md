Thanks to <a href="http://www.sixxs.net/">sixxs.net</a> I'm now connected to
the web 6.0. Setting up the tunnel on the server machine was easy thanks to
aiccu, only the openvpn routes for my other machines was a bit more tricky.
(Openvpn doesn't support "mode server" for ipv6 yet.)

On a sidenote, freewrt is much nicer to use on my Asus WL500gp than openwrt -
feels much more like Linux (even Debian) than the nvram stuff on openwrt.
