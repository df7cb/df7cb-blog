You know you have left the continent when you see this:

I've arrived all well, only that I made the same mistake as always - leaving
the house without writing down (or even looking up) the precise address where
to go. Luckily the information centre at the EDI airport had a web browser.
(And they didn't get scared away by repeated "This page contains insecure
media" warnings on debconf.org.)
