Today, the booth was a bit busier than yesterday, but we still had plenty of
time to spend on other stuff. Today's good news was that <a
href="http://wiki.mutt.org/">mutt</a> development seems to <a
href="http://www.df7cb.de/mutt/message/20050126.115002.110202ad.en.html">have
started again</a> and 1.5.7 should be released on Friday.

<p>In the meantime, I'm back in Saarbr&uuml;cken and put some pictures I took on the
event <a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/050224-LinuxDays.lu/">on my
website</a>.
