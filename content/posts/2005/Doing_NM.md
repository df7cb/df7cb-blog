I was assigned an AM last Friday. Marc sent me the P&amp;P questions on Sunday,
and I was able to get through all immediately, so that I spent this afternoon
on T&amp;S. The first P&amp;P half is really brain-damaging when you have to
read all that legalese stuff. The second half was definitely more fun, and the
first T&amp;S part also. Now it's getting harder again, but it looks like I
should be able to get through the rest of T&amp;S quickly. Then there's
the packages check left. The next <a href="http://wolfpack.twu.net/Endeavour2/">endeavour2</a>
should be released soon - let's see if it comes in time.
