The social event on Friday night was nice - this year, the queue in front of
the buffet wasn't 50m long. At one of the sillier moments we took pictures for
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050624-LinuxTag/36-Hot_Alfie_0_percent.html">Hot Alfie</a>
and
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050624-LinuxTag/47-Hot_enrico_0_percent.html">Hot enrico</a>
(ITPs to be submitted X-).

<p>
The main event on Saturday was the
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050625-LinuxTag/03-Keysigningparty.html">keysigning party</a>.
Peter tried a little variation of the usual "all line up" scheme by
initializing it with participants 70 to 1 on the right side and 71 to 154 on
the left. Surprisingly, everyone found their place quite fast and we were
finished in some 80min. <a href="http://pgp-tools.alioth.debian.org/">caff</a>
seems to be a real success this year, I've already received signatures from
some 20 people using it. <a href="http://cabot.alioth.debian.org/">cabot</a> is
still used used by some. I found most other systems either hard to handle
(requiring me to sign a challenge several times per key or send mail "from" a
uid) or broken (someone claimed one of my keys was signing-only which isn't
true). caff cannot yet handle multiple keys in batch, so I will probably
implement that before having to sign every key twice.

<p>
We started dismantling the booth around 5pm, which caused a last-minute rush
for the Debian T-shirts. Apparently, we sold the coolest on the whole fair :-)
Back at home at 9pm, I was quite exhausted, but managed to rename all pictures
and remove some of the less interesting. If I got some names wrong or omitted
some, please tell me.

<p>
Overall, Saturday saw more "end users" at the booth compared to the days
before, but certainly less than 2004. I don't know how many visitors managed to
get one of the free "eticket" invitations, but the default 15&euro; per day
certainly kept some away. If this trend continues, and a good part of the
LinuxTag staff is quitting as rumors say, maybe there won't be a LinuxTag
2006 - which would really be sad.
