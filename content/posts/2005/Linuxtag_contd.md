Yesterday evening saw the KALUG party which resulted in quite a lot of

Alexander Schmehl won an

Later during the night, for what was declared the official German Sarge release
party, Martin Zobel-Helas and Alexander Schmehl had prepared a
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050623-LinuxTag/75.html">Debian quiz</a>
show. People from the audience were "elected" to answer questions ranging from
"bring sarge/slink/hamm/rex in the right order" to "how many signatures does
Peter Palfrader have on his primary key?"

<p>
This morning, I took the level 101 LPI exam. The questions were mostly simple
("name a command that lists all PCI devices"), but some were outdated (USB on
Linux 2.2) or wrong (the command "export set DISPLAY=:0.1" does not really make
sense). The results will only be available in a few weeks, but I'm sure I
passed even without any training before.

<p>
Next thing to happen: the social event.
