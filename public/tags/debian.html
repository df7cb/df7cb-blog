    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Debian is running a &ldquo;<a href="https://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/vcswatch">vcswatch</a>&rdquo;
service that keeps track of the status of all packaging repositories that have a
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/best-pkging-practices.de.html#vcs"><tt>Vcs-Git</tt></a>
(and other VCSes) header set and shows which repos might need a package upload to push pending changes out.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is a lot of data and the scratch partition on qa.debian.org
had to be expanded several times, up to 300 GB in the last iteration.
Attempts to reduce that size using shallow clones (<tt>git clone &ndash;depth=50</tt>)
did not result more than a few percent of space saved. Running <tt>git gc</tt> on
all repos helps a bit, but is tedious and as Debian is growing, the repos are
still growing both in size and number. I ended up blocking all repos with
checkouts larger than a gigabyte, and still the only cure was expanding the
disk, or to lower the blocking threshold.</p>
<p>Since we only need a tiny bit of info from the repositories, namely the content
of <tt>debian/changelog</tt> and a few other files from <tt>debian/</tt>, plus
the number of commits since the last tag on the packaging branch, it made sense
to try to get the info without fetching a full repo clone. The question if we
could grab that solely using the GitLab API at salsa.debian.org was never
really answered. But then, in <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1032623">#1032623</a>,
Gábor Németh suggested the use of
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---filterltfilter-specgt"><tt>git clone &ndash;filter blob:none</tt></a>.
As things go, this sat unattended in the bug report for almost a year until the
next &ldquo;disk full&rdquo; event made me give it a try.</p>
<p>The <tt>blob:none</tt> filter makes git clone omit all files, fetching only commit and
tree information. Any blob (file content) needed at git run time is
transparently fetched from the upstream repository, and stored locally. It
turned out to be a game-changer. The (largish) repositories I tried it on
shrank to 1/100 of the original size.</p>
<p>Poking around I figured we could even do better by using <tt>tree:0</tt> as
filter. This additionally omits all trees from the git clone, again only
fetching the information at run time when needed. Some of the larger repos I
tried it on shrank to <em>1/1000</em> of their original size.</p>
<p>I deployed the new option on qa.debian.org and scheduled all repositories to
fetch a new clone on the next scan:</p>
<img src="https://www.df7cb.de/blog/2024/df-month.png">
<p>The initial dip from 100% to 95% is my first &ldquo;what happens if we block repos
&gt; 500 MB&rdquo; attempt. Over the week after that, the git filter clones reduce the
overall disk consumption from almost 300 GB to 15 GB, a <em>1/20</em>. Some
repos shrank from GBs to below a MB.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should make all my git clones use one of the filters.</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Back in 2015, when PostgreSQL 9.5 alpha 1 was released, I had posted the
<a href="https://www.df7cb.de/blog/2015/PostgreSQL_9.5_in_Debian.html">PostgreSQL data from Debian&rsquo;s popularity contest</a>.</p>
<p>8 years and 8 PostgreSQL releases later, the graph now looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://qa.debian.org/popcon-graph.php?packages=postgresql+postgresql-7.4+postgresql-8.0+postgresql-8.1+postgresql-8.2+postgresql-8.3+postgresql-8.4+postgresql-9.0+postgresql-9.1+postgresql-9.2+postgresql-9.3+postgresql-9.4+postgresql-9.5+postgresql-9.6+postgresql-10+postgresql-11+postgresql-12+postgresql-13+postgresql-14+postgresql-15+postgresql-16&show_installed=on&want_legend=on&want_ticks=on&from_date=&to_date=&hlght_date=&date_fmt=%25Y-%25m&beenhere=1"><img src="https://www.df7cb.de/blog/2023/popcon-postgresql.png"></a></p>
<p>Currently, the most popular PostgreSQL on Debian systems is still PostgreSQL 13 (shipped in Bullseye), followed by PostgreSQL 11 (Buster). At the time of writing,
PostgreSQL 9.6 (Stretch) and PostgreSQL 15 (Bookworm) share the third place, with 15 rising quickly.</p>

      <h2 id="pg_dirtyread">pg_dirtyread</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, I updated <a href="https://github.com/df7cb/pg_dirtyread">pg_dirtyread</a>
to work with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html">PostgreSQL 14</a>.
pg_dirtyread is a PostgreSQL extension that allows reading &ldquo;dead&rdquo; rows from
tables, i.e. rows that have already been deleted, or updated. Of course that
works only if the table has not been cleaned-up yet by a VACUUM command or
autovacuum, which is PostgreSQL&rsquo;s garbage collection machinery.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of pg_dirtyread in action:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># create table foo (id int, t text);
CREATE TABLE
# insert into foo values (1, &#39;Doc1&#39;);
INSERT 0 1
# insert into foo values (2, &#39;Doc2&#39;);
INSERT 0 1
# insert into foo values (3, &#39;Doc3&#39;);
INSERT 0 1

# select * from foo;
 id │  t
────┼──────
  1 │ Doc1
  2 │ Doc2
  3 │ Doc3
(3 rows)

# delete from foo where id &lt; 3;
DELETE 2

# select * from foo;
 id │  t
────┼──────
  3 │ Doc3
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Oops! The first two documents have disappeared.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s use pg_dirtyread to look at the table:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># create extension pg_dirtyread;
CREATE EXTENSION

# select * from pg_dirtyread(&#39;foo&#39;) t(id int, t text);
 id │  t
────┼──────
  1 │ Doc1
  2 │ Doc2
  3 │ Doc3
</code></pre><p>All three documents are still there, but only one of them is visible.</p>
<p>pg_dirtyread can also show PostgreSQL&rsquo;s system colums with the row location and
visibility information. For the first two documents, xmax is set, which means
the row has been deleted:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># select * from pg_dirtyread(&#39;foo&#39;) t(ctid tid, xmin xid, xmax xid, id int, t text);
 ctid  │ xmin │ xmax │ id │  t
───────┼──────┼──────┼────┼──────
 (0,1) │ 1577 │ 1580 │  1 │ Doc1
 (0,2) │ 1578 │ 1580 │  2 │ Doc2
 (0,3) │ 1579 │    0 │  3 │ Doc3
(3 rows)
</code></pre><h2 id="undelete">Undelete</h2>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> <em>I&rsquo;m not promising any of the ideas quoted below will actually work in
practice. There are a few caveats and a good portion of intricate knowledge
about the PostgreSQL internals might be required to succeed properly. Consider
consulting your favorite PostgreSQL support channel for advice if you need to
recover data on any production system.</em> <strong>Don&rsquo;t try this at work.</strong></p>
<p>I always had plans to extend pg_dirtyread to include some &ldquo;undelete&rdquo; command to
make deleted rows reappear, but never got around to trying that. But rows can already be
restored by using the output of pg_dirtyread itself:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># insert into foo select * from pg_dirtyread(&#39;foo&#39;) t(id int, t text) where id = 1;
</code></pre><p>This is not a true &ldquo;undelete&rdquo;, though - it just inserts new rows from the data
read from the table.</p>
<h2 id="pg_surgery">pg_surgery</h2>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgsurgery.html">pg_surgery</a>,
which is a new PostgreSQL extension supplied with PostgreSQL 14. It contains
two functions to &ldquo;perform surgery on a damaged relation&rdquo;. As a side-effect,
they can also make delete tuples reappear.</p>
<p>As I discovered now, one of the functions, heap_force_freeze(), works nicely
with pg_dirtyread. It takes a list of ctids (row locations) that it marks
&ldquo;frozen&rdquo;, but at the same time as &ldquo;not deleted&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s apply it to our test table, using the ctids that pg_dirtyread can read:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># create extension pg_surgery;
CREATE EXTENSION

# select heap_force_freeze(&#39;foo&#39;, array_agg(ctid))
    from pg_dirtyread(&#39;foo&#39;) t(ctid tid, xmin xid, xmax xid, id int, t text) where id = 1;
 heap_force_freeze
───────────────────

(1 row)

        arm64 on apt.postgresql.org

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The <a href="https://apt.postgresql.org/">apt.postgresql.org</a> repository has been extended
to cover the <em>arm64</em> architecture.</p>
<p>We had occasionally received user request to add &ldquo;arm&rdquo; in the past, but it was
never really clear which kind of &ldquo;arm&rdquo; made sense to target for PostgreSQL. In
terms of Debian architectures, there&rsquo;s (at least) armel, armhf, and arm64.
Furthermore, Raspberry Pis are very popular (and indeed what most users seemed
to were asking about), but the raspbian &ldquo;armhf&rdquo; port is incompatible with the
Debian &ldquo;armhf&rdquo; port.</p>
<p>Now that most hardware has moved to 64-bit, it was becoming clear that &ldquo;arm64&rdquo;
was the way to go. Amit Khandekar made it happen that
<a href="https://intl.huaweicloud.com/en-us/">HUAWEI Cloud Services</a>
donated a arm64 build host with enough resources to build the arm64 packages
at the same speed as the existing amd64, i386, and ppc64el architectures.
A few days later, all the build jobs were done, including passing all
test-suites. Very few arm-specific issues were encountered which makes me
confident that arm64 is a solid architecture to run PostgreSQL on.</p>
<p>We are targeting Debian buster (stable), bullseye (testing), and sid
(unstable), and Ubuntu bionic (18.04) and focal (20.04). To use the arm64
archive, just add the normal sources.list entry:</p>
<pre>
deb https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt buster-pgdg main
</pre>
<h2>Ubuntu focal</h2>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;ve added the next Ubuntu LTS release to apt.postgresql.org:
focal (20.04). It ships amd64, arm64, and ppc64el binaries.</p>
<pre>
deb https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt focal-pgdg main
</pre>
<h2>Old PostgreSQL versions</h2>
<p>Many PostgreSQL extensions are still supporting older server versions that are
EOL. For testing these extension, server packages need to be available. I&rsquo;ve
built packages for PostgreSQL 9.2+ on all Debian distributions, and all Ubuntu
LTS distributions. 9.1 will follow shortly.</p>
<p>This means people can move to newer base distributions in their .travis.yml,
.gitlab-ci.yml, and other CI files.</p>

        Announcing apt-archive.postgresql.org
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Users had often asked where they could find older versions of packages from
<a href="https://apt.postgresql.org/">apt.postgresql.org</a>. I had been
collecting these since about April 2013, and in July 2016, I made the packages
available via an ad-hoc URL on the repository master host, called &ldquo;the morgue&rdquo;.
There was little repository structure, all files belonging to a source package
were stuffed into a single directory, no matter what distribution they belonged
to. Besides this not being particularly accessible for users, the main problem
was the ever-increasing need for more disk space on the repository host. We are
now at 175 GB for the archive, of which 152 GB is for the morgue.</p>
<p>Our friends from <a href="https://yum.postgresql.org/">yum.postgresql.org</a>
have had a proper archive host (yum-archive.postgresql.org) for some time
already, so it was about time to follow suit and implement a proper archive
for apt.postgresql.org as well, usable from apt.</p>
<p>So here it is:
<b><a href="https://apt-archive.postgresql.org/">apt-archive.postgresql.org</a></b></p>
<p>The archive covers all past and current Debian and Ubuntu distributions. The
apt sources.lists entries are similar to the main repository, just with &ldquo;-archive&rdquo;
appended to the host name and the
<a href="https://apt-archive.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/dists/index.html">distribution</a>:</p>
<pre>
deb https://apt-archive.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt DIST-pgdg-archive main
deb-src https://apt-archive.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt DIST-pgdg-archive main
</pre>
<p>The oldest PostgreSQL server versions covered there are 8.2.23, 8.3.23, 8.4.17,
9.0.13, 9.1.9, 9.2.4, 9.3beta1, and everything newer.</p>
<p>Some example:</p>

<p>Because this is hosted on S3, browsing directories is only supported indirectly by
static index.html files, so if you want to look at some specific URL, append
&ldquo;/index.html&rdquo; to see it.</p>
<p>The archive is powered by a
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgapt.git;a=tree;f=pgapt-db/sql">PostgreSQL database</a> and a
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgapt.git;a=tree;f=repo/bin">bunch of python/shell scripts</a>,
from which the apt index files are built.</p>
<h2>Archiving old distributions</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using the opportunity to remove some long-retired distributions from the main
repository host. The following distributions have been moved over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian etch (4.0)</li>
<li>Debian lenny (5.0)</li>
<li>Debian squeeze (6.0)</li>
<li>Ubuntu lucid (10.04)</li>
<li>Ubuntu saucy (13.10)</li>
<li>Ubuntu utopic (14.10)</li>
<li>Ubuntu wily (15.10)</li>
<li>Ubuntu zesty (17.04)</li>
<li>Ubuntu cosmic (18.10)</li>
</ul>
<p>They are available as &ldquo;<em>DIST</em>-pgdg&rdquo; from the archive, e.g. squeeze:</p>

        vcswatch is now looking for tags
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>About a week ago, I extended
<em><a href="https://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/vcswatch">vcswatch</a></em>
to also look at tags in git repositories.</p>
<p>Previously, it was solely paying attention to the version number in the top
paragraph in debian/changelog, and would alert if that version didn&rsquo;t match the
package version in Debian unstable or experimental. The idea is that <em>&ldquo;UNRELEASED&rdquo;</em>
versions will keep nagging the maintainer
(via <a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php">DDPO</a>)
not to forget that some day this package needs an upload. This works for git,
svn, bzr, hg, cvs, mtn, and darcs repositories (in decreasing order of actual
usage numbers in Debian. I had actually tried to add arch support as well, but
that VCS is so weird that it wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble).</p>
<p>There are several shortcomings in that simple approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some packages update debian/changelog only at release time, e.g. auto-generated from the git changelog using <em>git-dch</em></li>
<li>Missing or misplaced release tags are not detected</li>
</ul>
<p>The new mechanism fixes this for git repositories by also looking at the output
of <em>git describe &ndash;tags</em>. If there are any commits since the last tag, and the
vcswatch status according to debian/changelog would otherwise be <em>&ldquo;OK&rdquo;</em>, a new
status <em>&ldquo;COMMITS&rdquo;</em> is set. DDPO will report e.g. &ldquo;1.4-1+2&rdquo;, to be read as &ldquo;2
commits since the tag [debian/]1.4-1&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of the 16644 packages using git in Debian, currently 7327 are &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, 2649 are in
the new &ldquo;COMMITS&rdquo; state, and 4227 are &ldquo;NEW&rdquo;. 723 are &ldquo;OLD&rdquo; and 79 are &ldquo;UNREL&rdquo;
which indicates that the package in Debian is ahead of the git repository. 1639
are in an ERROR state.</p>
<p>So far the new mechanism works for git only, but other VCSes could be added as
well.</p>

      <p>I knew it was about this time of the year 10 years ago when my Debian account
was created, but I couldn&rsquo;t remember the exact date until I looked it up
earlier this evening: today :). Rene Engelhard had been my advocate, and Marc
Brockschmidt my AM. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>A lot of time has passed since then, and I&rsquo;ve worked in various parts of the
project. I became an application manager almost immediately, and quickly got
into the NM front desk as well, revamping parts of the NM process which had
become pretty bureaucratic (I think we are now, 10 years later, back where we
should be, thanks to almost all of the paperwork being automated, thanks
Enrico!). I&rsquo;ve processed 37 NMs, most of them between 2005 and 2008, later I
was only active as front desk and eventually Debian account manager. I&rsquo;ve
recently picked up AMing again, which I still find quite refreshing as the AM
will always also learn new things.</p>
<p>Quality Assurance was and is the other big field. Starting by doing QA uploads
of orphaned packages, I attended some QA meetings around Germany, and picked up
maintenance of the DDPO pages, which I still maintain. The link between QA and
NM is the MIA team where I was active for some years until they kindly kicked
me out because I was MIA there myself. I&rsquo;m glad they are still using some of
the scripts I was writing to automate some things.</p>
<p>My favorite MUA is mutt, of which I became co-maintainer in 2007, and later
maintainer. I&rsquo;m still listed in the uploaders field, but admittedly I haven&rsquo;t
really done anything there lately.</p>
<p>Also in 2007 I started working at credativ, after having been a research
assistant at the university, which meant making my Debian work professional. Of
course it also meant more real work and less time for the hobby part, but I was
still very active around that time. Later in 2010 I was marrying, and we got
two kids, at which point family was of course much more important, so my Debian
involvement dropped to a minimum. (Mostly lurking on IRC ;)</p>
<p>Being a PostgreSQL consultant at work, it was natural to start looking into the
packaging, so I started submitting patches to postgresql-common in 2011, and
became a co-maintainer in 2012. Since then, I&rsquo;ve mostly been working on
PostgreSQL-related packages, of which far too many have my (co-)maintainer
stamp on them. To link the Debian and PostgreSQL worlds together, we started an
external repository (apt.postgresql.org) that contains packages for the
PostgreSQL major releases that Debian doesn&rsquo;t ship. Most of my open source time
at the moment is spent on getting all PostgreSQL packages in shape for Debian
and this repository.</p>
<p>According to minechangelogs, currently 844 changelog entries in Debian mention
my name, or were authored by me. Scrolling back yields memories of packages
that are long gone again from unstable, or I passed on to other maintainers.
There are way too many people in Debian that I enjoy(ed) working with to list
them here, and many of them are my friends. Debian is really the extended
family on the internet. My last DebConf before this year had been in Mar del
Plata - I had met some people at other conferences like FOSDEM, but meeting
(almost) everyone again in Heidelberg was very nice. I even remembered all
basic Mao rules :D.</p>

<p>Before we included the PostgreSQL major version in the package name,
&ldquo;postgresql&rdquo; contained the server, so that line represents the installation
count of the pre-7.4 releases at the left end of the graph.</p>
<p>Interestingly, 7.4 reached its installation peak well past 8.1&rsquo;s. Does anyone have an
idea why that happened?</p>

Ubuntu 13.10 codenamed &ldquo;saucy&rdquo; and the upcoming Ubuntu LTS release 14.04

<p>Adding non-LTS releases for the benefit of developers using PostgreSQL on their
notebooks and desktop machines has been a frequently requested item since we
created the repository. I had some qualms about targeting a new Ubuntu release
every 6 months, but with having automated more and more parts of the repository
infrastructure, and the bootstrapping process now being painless, the
distributions are now available for use. Technically, trusty started as empty,
so it hasn&rsquo;t all packages yet, but of course all the PostgreSQL server packages
are there, along with pgAdmin. Saucy started as a copy of precise (12.04) so it
has all packages. Not all packages have been rebuilt for saucy, but the precise
packages included (you can tell by the version number ending in .pgdg12.4+12 or
.pgdg13.10+1) will work, unless apt complains about dependency problems. I have
rebuilt the packages needing it I was aware about (most notably the
postgresql-plperl packages) - if you spot problems, please let us know on the
mailing list.</p>
<p>Needless to say, last week&rsquo;s PostgreSQL server updates are already included in
the repository.</p>

        TF101 flickering and a loose cable
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>My ASUS Transformer TF101 had suddenly started flickering in all sorts of funny
colors some weeks ago. As tapping it gently on the table in the right angle made
the problem go away temporarily, it was clear the problem was about a loose
cable, or some other hardware connection issue.</p>
<p>As I needed to go on a business trip the other day, I didn&rsquo;t look up the
warranty expiration day until later that week. Then, Murphy struck: the tablet
was now 2 years + 1 day old! Calling ASUS, some friendly guy there suggested I
still tried to get ASUS to accept it for warranty, because the tablet had been
with them last year for 5 days, so if they added that, it would still be within
the warranty period. I filled out the RMA form, but one hour later the reply was
they rejected it because it was out of warranty. Another guy on the phone then
said they would probably only do the adding if it had been with them for maybe
10 days, or actually really 30 days, or whatever.</p>
<p>Some googling suggested that the loose cable theory was indeed worth a try, so I
took <a

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG9gEYRALtU">apart</a>. Thanks to a
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=48273006">forum
post</a> I could then locate the display connector and fix it.</p>
<p>Putting the case back together was actually harder than disassembling it because
some plastic bits got stuck, but now everything is back to normal.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Following an idea by Ansgar Burchardt, I&rsquo;ve done some digging on version numbers in Debian:</p>
<p>
Most common version numbers:
<pre>
projectb=> select version::text, count(*) from source group by 1 order by 2 desc;
  version   | count 
------------+-------
 4:4.10.5-1 |   131
 1.0-1      |   120
 1.0.0-1    |    95
 1.1-1      |    95
 1.0.1-1    |    93
 1.2-1      |    88
 1.0-2      |    82
 0.2-1      |    80
 0.3-1      |    79
 0.5-1      |    77
 0.04-1     |    76
 1.1.1-1    |    76
 0.10-1     |    74
 1.4-1      |    72
 1.1-2      |    71
 0.1-1      |    70
 0.11-1     |    70
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Version number with the most spellings: (considered equal by the dpkg
definition, implemented in the "debversion" type)
<pre>
projectb=> select version::text, count(*) from source where version = '1.02-1' group by 1 order by 2 desc;
  version   | count 
------------+-------
 1.2-1      |    88
 1.02-1     |    46
 1.002-1    |     4
 1.000002-1 |     1
 001.002-1  |     1
 1.00002-1  |     1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If we look at equivalent version numbers, the first table above looks entirely different:
<pre>
projectb=> select version, count(*) from source group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 30;
  version   | count 
------------+-------
 0.3-1      |   162
 1.0-1      |   160
 0.05-1     |   156
 0.04-1     |   154
 0.02-1     |   151
 1.02-1     |   141
 0.006-1    |   133
 1.001-1    |   131
 4:4.10.5-1 |   131
 0.7-1      |   127

      <p>So we finally made it, and sent out an
<a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-announce/2012-12/msg00008.php">official announcement</a> for
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">apt.postgresql.org</a>.</p>
<p>This new repository hosts packages for all PostgreSQL server versions (at the
moment 8.3, 8.4, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2) for several Debian/Ubuntu distributions
(squeeze, wheezy, sid, precise) on two architectures (amd64, i386). Now add
packages for extension modules on top of all these, and you get a really large
amount of binaries from a small number of sources. Right now there&rsquo;s 1670 .deb
files and 148 .dsc files, but the .dsc count includes variants that only differ
in the version number per distribution (we attach .pgdg60+1 for squeeze
packages, .pgdg70+1 for wheezy and so on), so the real number of different
sources is rather something like 81, with 38 distinct source package names.</p>
<p><a href="http://tapoueh.org/">Dimitri Fontaine</a>,
<a href="http://www.hagander.net/">Magnus Hagander</a>, and I have been working
on this since I first presented the idea at PGconf.EU 2011 in Amsterdam. We now
have a Jenkins server building all the packages, an archive server with the
master repository, and a feed that syncs the repository to the postgresql.org
FTP (well, mostly http) server.</p>
<p>If you were previously using pgapt.debian.net, that&rsquo;s the same archive as on
apt.postgresql.org (one rsync away). Please update your sources.list to point
to apt.postgresql.org, I&rsquo;ll shut down the archive at that location at the end
of January.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt#Quickstart">Quickstart
instructions from the Wiki page</a>:</p>
<p>Import the repository key from <a href="http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc">http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc</a>:</p>
<pre>
wget -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
</pre>
<p>Edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list. The distributions are called codename-pgdg. In the example, replace squeeze with the actual distribution you are using:</p>
<pre>
deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ squeeze-pgdg main
</pre>
<p>Configure apt&rsquo;s package pinning to prefer the PGDG packages over the Debian ones in /etc/apt/preferences.d/pgdg.pref:</p>
<pre>
Package: *
Pin: release o=apt.postgresql.org
Pin-Priority: 500
</pre>
<p>Note: this will replace all your Debian/Ubuntu packages with available packages from the PGDG repository. If you do not want this, skip this step.</p>
<p>Update the package lists, and install the pgdg-keyring package to automatically get repository key updates:</p>
<pre>
apt-get update
apt-get install pgdg-keyring

      <p>We have a PostgreSQL server with 16 cores that was apparently running well
below its capacity: load something between 3.0 and 4.0, around 200 active
database connections, almost all always being &lt;IDLE&gt;. However, when the
tps count reached 7k transactions per second, things started to throttle, and
pgbouncer (running on the database server) started listing up to half of the
client connections to be in cl_waiting state. Load was still low, but
application performance was bad.</p>
<img src="http://www.df7cb.de/blog/2012/renice_pgbouncer.png">
<p>The culprit turned out to be the kernel scheduler, fairly distributing CPU time
among all running processes. There&rsquo;s one single pgbouncer process, but hundreds
of postgres processes.</p>
<p>A simple <em>renice</em> of the pgbouncer process did the trick and gave us another
extra 2k tps.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have this PostgreSQL server with plenty of RAM that is still using some of
its swap over the day (up to 600MB). Then suddenly everything is swapped in
again.</p>
<img src="http://www.df7cb.de/blog/2012/dbsrv_swap.png">
<p>It turned out the reason is there are two clusters running, and the second one
isn&rsquo;t used as heavily as the first one. Disk I/O activity of the first cluster
slowly evicts pages from the second shared buffers cache to swap, and then the
daily pg_dump run reads them back every evening.</p>
<p>I was not aware of an easy way to get numbers for &ldquo;amount of SysV shared memory
swapped to disk&rdquo;, but some googling led to shmctl(2):</p>
<pre>
#define _GNU_SOURCE 1
#include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main ()
{
        struct shm_info info;
        int max;
        long PAGE_SIZE = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);

        max = shmctl(0, SHM_INFO, (struct shmid_ds *) &info);
        printf ("max: %d\nshm_tot: %ld\nshm_rss: %ld\nshm_swp: %ld\n",
                        max,
                        info.shm_tot * PAGE_SIZE,
                        info.shm_rss * PAGE_SIZE,
                        info.shm_swp * PAGE_SIZE);

        return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The output looks like this:</p>
<pre>
max: 13
shm_tot: 13232308224
shm_rss: 12626661376
shm_swp: 601616384

        PostgreSQL in Debian Hackathon
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Almost a year has passed since my talk at pgconf.eu 2011 in Amsterdam on
<a href="http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2011/session/166-connecting-the-debian-and-postgresql-worlds/">Connecting the Debian and PostgreSQL worlds</a>,
and unfortunately little has happened on that front, mostly due to my limited
spare time between family and job.
<a href="http://pgapt.debian.net/">pgapt.debian.net</a> is up and running, but
got few updates and is lagging behind on PostgreSQL releases.</p>
<p>Luckily, we got the project moving. <a href="http://tapoueh.org/blog/index.html">Dimitri Fontaine</a>
and <a href="http://blog.hagander.net/">Magnus Hagander</a> suggested to do a
face-to-face meeting, so we got together at my house for two days last week and
discussed ideas, repository layouts, build scripts, and whatnot to get all of
us aligned for pushing the project ahead. My
<a href="http://www.credativ.de/">employer</a> sponsored my time off work for
that. We almost finished moving the repository to postgresql.org
infrastructure, barring some questions of how to hook the repository into the
existing mirror infrastructure; this should get resolved this week.</p>
<p>The build server running Jenkins is still located on my laptop, but moving this
to a proper host will also happen really soon now. We are using
<a href="http://michael-prokop.at/blog/">Mika Prokop</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="http://jenkins-debian-glue.org/">jenkins-debian-glue</a> scripts for
driving the package build from Jenkins. The big plus point about Jenkins is
that it makes executing jobs on different distributions and architectures in
parallel much easier than a bunch of homemade shell scripts could get us with
reasonable effort.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of random points we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>We decided to go for &ldquo;pgdg&rdquo; in version numbers and distribution names, i.e.
packages will have version numbers like 9.1.5-1.pgdg+1, with distributions
wheezy-pgdg, squeeze-pgdg, and so on.</li>
<li>There will be Debian-testing-style distributions called like
wheezy-pgdg-testing that packages go into for some time before they get
promoted to the &ldquo;live&rdquo; distributions.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL versions out of support (8.2 and below) will not be removed from
the repository, but will be moved to distributions called like
wheezy-pgdg-deprecated. People will still be able to use them, but the
naming should make it clear that they should really be upgrading.</li>
<li>We have a slightly modified (compared to Debian unstable) postgresql-common
package that sets the &ldquo;supported-versions&rdquo; to all versions supported by the
PostgreSQL project. That will make the postgresql-server-dev-all package
pull in build-dependencies for all server versions, and make extension
module packages compile for all of them automatically. (Provided they are
using pg_buildext.)</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no Ubuntu support in there yet, but that&rsquo;s mostly only a matter of
adding more cowbuilder chroots to the build jobs. TBD soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>We really aim at using unmodified packages from Debian as much as possible, and
in fact this project doesn&rsquo;t mean to replace Debian&rsquo;s PostgreSQL packaging
work, but to extend it beyond the number of server versions (and Debian and
Ubuntu versions covered) supported. The people behind the Debian and Ubuntu
packages, and this repository are mostly the same, so we will claim that &ldquo;our&rdquo;
packages will be the same quality as the &ldquo;original&rdquo; ones. Big thanks go to
<a href="http://www.piware.de/">Martin Pitt</a> for maintaining the
postgresql-common testsuite that really covers every aspect of running
PostgreSQL servers on Debian/Ubuntu systems.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates! :)</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>PostgreSQL&rsquo;s libpq5 package got its symbols file somewhere around version 8.4,
so the symbols in there were all marked with version &ldquo;8.4~&rdquo; or greater. As I&rsquo;m
working on <a href="http://pgapt.debian.net">pgapt.debian.net</a> aiming at
providing packages for all upstream-supported PG versions (currently 8.3 and
up), this made packages incompatible with 8.3&rsquo;s libpq5.</p>
<p>There didn&rsquo;t seem to be a ready program to feed a series of .deb files which
would then run dpkg-gensymbols and build a symbols file, so I wrote this shell
script:</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

[ -d tmp ] || mkdir tmp

i=1

for pkg in "$@" ; do
	echo "$pkg"
	test -e "$pkg"
	name=$(dpkg-deb -I "$pkg" | perl -lne 'print $1 if /^ Package: (.+)/')
	version=$(dpkg-deb -I "$pkg" | perl -lne 'print $1 if /^ Version: (.+)/')
	out=$(printf "tmp/%03d_%s" $i "$version")
	dpkg-deb -x "$pkg" "$out"
	dpkg-gensymbols -P"$out" -p"$name" -v"$version" \
		${oldsymbols:+-I"$oldsymbols"} -O"$out.symbols" | \
		tee "$out.symbols.diff"
	test -s "$out.symbols.diff" || rm "$out.symbols.diff"
	oldsymbols="$out.symbols"
	rm -rf "$out"
	i=$(expr $i + 1)
done
</pre>
<p>To use it, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>debsnap -a i386 libpq5
<li>ls binary-libpq5/*.deb > files
<li>edit "files" to have proper ordering (~rc versions before releases, remove bpo versions, etc.)
<li>./walk-symbols $(cat files)
</ul>
<p>The highest-numbered *.symbols file in tmp/ will then have symbol information
for all packages. I then did some manual post-processing like s/<del>rc1-1/</del>/ to
get nice (and backportable) version numbers.</p>
<p>Another nice trick (pointed out by jcristau) is to replace the lowest version
number of that package (8.2~ here, where libpq changed SONAME) by 0 which will
make dpkg-shlibdeps omit the &gt;= version part. (Most packages depending on
libpq5 will profit from that.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still pondering whether this script is non-trivial enough add to
devscripts. (The people I asked so far only made comments about the mkdir
call&hellip;)</p>

        PostgreSQL in Debian

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>At work, I&rsquo;m dealing with lots of different database setups, luckily mostly
PostgreSQL running on Debian. At the same time, a fair amount of the tools in
the PostgreSQL ecosystem (not the PostgreSQL server packages itself) are not in
the best shape in the Debian archive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to change that by adopting some of the packages. So far, I have
fixed a few RC bugs where packages where suddenly trying to build against
PostgreSQL 9.0 while expecting 8.4. To my surprise, there are no packages yet
in the archive that support multiple PostgreSQL versions in parallel. There is
even a package ready to help doing this -
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/postgresql-server-dev-all">postgresql-server-dev-all</a>,
but apparently nobody has used it yet. It turned out that after working around
a few trivial problems and adding just a few lines of sh code, it was pretty
straightforward
to port <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/skytools.html">skytools</a> and
<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/postgresql-pllua.html">postgresql-pllua</a>
to 9.0 while keeping 8.4 support. The latter has no version-specific code left
in debian/ except for a list of supported versions in debian/pgversions, so a
future port to 9.1 will be trivial. (Fun fact: the old postgresql-pllua version
0.8.1 was actually a typoed 0.3.1 version.)</p>
<p>Most PostgreSQL tools use a common
<a href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-postgresql/trunk/">subversion repository on Alioth</a>,
but there is no common mailing list address that is put into the Uploaders
fields, so it is hard to get an overview over the state of all packages. I&rsquo;ve
compiled a list of all packages in svn, git, bzr (the server packages), and a
few others
<a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=pkg-postgresql-public@lists.alioth.debian.org">in DDPO</a>
to fix that for now.</p>
<p>Other packages I&rsquo;ve updated so far are
<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/pgtune.html">pgtune</a>,
<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/pgbouncer.html">pgbouncer</a>, and

        HP 2605dn not regcognizing new cartridge
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>When my wife bought her HP 2605dn color laser, she had also ordered a set of
replacement cartridges because the originals would supposedly not last very
long. It turned out that they would last over two years, though.</p>
<p>Now, the black cartridge was empty. The replacements are original HP
components, but recycled/refilled second hand from a different source. I put in
the black one, and the trouble started with the new drum having a big scratch
that would appear in every print. After two years, returning the cartridge was
not an option. As the old drum was still good, the idea was
to put the new toner into the old cartridge. A bit of googling (and visual
inspection) quickly revealed that you are not supposed to do this, the device
doesn&rsquo;t have any facilities to access anything.</p>
<p>Some post did indicate though that the cartridge actually consists of two parts
that are only held together by two pivot pins and two small springs. If you
pull the two parts apart a bit, you can feel the axis the parts are moving
around. So, I would try to use the old drum part with the new toner container
part.</p>
<p>Removing the springs is easy (also removing the flap covering the drum, along
with a tiny third spring). The two pivot pins are pretty inaccessible, but I
managed to pull out both using a pointy tong. One pin is made of metal, if you
need more space you can drill a small hole right next to it. The other pin is
made of plastic with a small hole in it, in one case I succeeded by screwing in
a little screw and pulling at it.</p>
<p>Reassembling the parts is not so hard. I put the &ldquo;new&rdquo; cartridge into the
printer, waited for the initialization to finish, only to find out the printer
would still think the cartridge was empty and should be replaced. Duh.</p>
<p>I then discovered a small chip attached to one corner of the drum unit,
probably carrying product ID and some serial number. Luckily, it was easy to
be removed and exchanged with the other drum unit. Still, the printer thought
the cartridge was empty. Some (windows) driver re-installations later it was
clear that there is no &ldquo;ignore fill level and print anyway&rdquo; option. (Cups
didn&rsquo;t print either.)</p>
<p>The HP Support Forum has a long
<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Other-printing-questions/Ink-cartridge-empty-but-it-s-not/td-p/4101">Ink cartridge empty but it&rsquo;s not</a>
thread with lots of complaints but few answers. (Their problem is mostly with
new HP cartridges becoming &ldquo;empty&rdquo; after a few days.) Someone suggests trying
to cold reset the printer. For the 2605dn, that&rsquo;s holding the left and right
buttons while powering on. I removed the cartridges for doing so. When I had
put them back in, the printer asked me to confirm that non-HP material was
installed, and subsequently didn&rsquo;t display any fill level for the black
cartridge anymore, just &ldquo;|?|&rdquo; in the display.</p>
<p>Printing works now. Yay.</p>
<p>(Lesson learned: I still hate dealing with printers.)</p>

      <p>Lockfiles are usually hard to get right, especially in sh scripts. The best bet
so far was &ldquo;lockfile&rdquo; included with procmail, but its semantics are pretty
weird. (Try to understand what exit code you want, with or without &ldquo;-!&rdquo;.) Not
to mention that failing to clean up the lockfile will stop the next cron run,
etc.</p>

<p>The use case is obvious:</p>

didn&rsquo;t know gnulib before (it had slipped my attention until recently), it is a
library of portability functions and other useful things. Adding it to a
project is simply done by calling gnulib-tool and tweaking a few lines in the

      <p>I&rsquo;m a fan of LC_MESSAGES=de_DE and localized web pages &ndash; almost.
Unfortunately, the wording of many translations in Debian often drives me nuts.
This applies mostly to web pages and package descriptions. Apologies to all
hard-working translators &ndash; the percentage of good translations does not
outweigh the &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; cases for me. Still, I didn&rsquo;t want to switch to English for
all the web.</p>
<p>Rhonda pointed me to a Firefox ^W Iceweasel plugin:
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11327/">HeaderControl</a>.
Now *.debian.org is English for me (reading the constitution in German doesn&rsquo;t
solve DAM problems anyway). Yay!</p>

been updated to support parallel computation in multiple threads. The parscore

<p>More on the technical side, the GUI has been switched to use GtkBuilder which
comes with Gtk so there is no external library needed anymore (previously
libglade). The looks are pretty much the same as before, though.</p>
<p>The previous version 0.9 had added windows support via mingw. I would still

        Using multiple IMAP accounts with Mutt
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Mutt&rsquo;s configuration is sometime more a toolbox than something offering ready
solutions, and &ldquo;how to I use multiple accounts?&rdquo; is one of the most FAQs.
Here&rsquo;s a condensed version of my setup.</p>
<p>In the most simple solution, just &lsquo;c&rsquo;hange folders to the IMAP server:</p>
<pre><code>c imaps://imap.example.com &lt;enter&gt;
c imaps://imap.otherdomain.tld &lt;enter&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That&rsquo;s cumbersome to type, so let&rsquo;s automate it:</p>
<pre><code># .mutt/muttrc
macro index &lt;f2&gt; '&lt;change-folder&gt;imaps://imap.example.com&lt;enter&gt;'
macro index &lt;f3&gt; '&lt;change-folder&gt;imaps://imap.otherdomain.tld&lt;enter&gt;'
</code></pre>
<p>That would be the basic setup.</p>
<p>The two accounts have settings associated with them, we put them in two files:</p>
<pre><code># .mutt/account.example
set from=me@example.com
set hostname=&quot;example.com&quot;
set folder=&quot;imaps://imap.example.com/&quot;
set postponed=&quot;=Drafts&quot;
set spoolfile=&quot;imaps://imap.example.com/INBOX&quot;
set signature=&quot;~/.mutt/signature.example&quot;
set smtp_url=&quot;smtp://me@mail.example.com&quot; smtp_pass=&quot;$my_pw_example&quot;

# .mutt/account.otherdomain
set from=myself@otherdomain.tld
set hostname=&quot;otherdomain.tld&quot;
set folder=&quot;imaps://imap.otherdomain.tld/&quot;
set postponed=&quot;=Drafts&quot;
set spoolfile=&quot;imaps://imap.otherdomain.tld/INBOX&quot;
set signature=&quot;~/.mutt/signature.otherdomain&quot;
set smtp_url=&quot;smtp://myself@mail.otherdomain.tld&quot; smtp_pass=&quot;$my_pw_otherdomain&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now all that&rsquo;s left to do is two folder-hooks to load the files:</p>
<pre><code># .mutt/muttrc
folder-hook 'example.com' 'source ~/.mutt/account.example'
folder-hook 'otherdomain.tld' 'source ~/.mutt/account.otherdomain'
# switch to default account on startup
source ~/.mutt/account.example
</code></pre>
<p>A slight variation of the macros also uses the account files:</p>
<pre><code>macro index &lt;f2&gt; '&lt;sync-mailbox&gt;&lt;enter-command&gt;source ~/.mutt/account.example&lt;enter&gt;&lt;change-folder&gt;!&lt;enter&gt;'
macro index &lt;f3&gt; '&lt;sync-mailbox&gt;&lt;enter-command&gt;source ~/.mutt/account.otherdomain&lt;enter&gt;&lt;change-folder&gt;!&lt;enter&gt;'
</code></pre>
<p>To save entering the password all the time, we use account-hooks:</p>
<pre><code>account-hook example.org 'set imap_user=me imap_pass=pw1'
account-hook otherdomain.tld 'set imap_user=myself imap_pass=pw2'
</code></pre>
<p>Putting passwords in configs isn&rsquo;t something I like, so I pull them from the
Gnome keyring:</p>
<pre><code>set my_pw_example=`gnome-keyring-query get mutt_example`
set my_pw_otherdomain=`gnome-keyring-query get mutt_otherdomain`
account-hook example.org 'set imap_user=me imap_pass=$my_pw_example'
account-hook otherdomain.tld 'set imap_user=myself imap_pass=$my_pw_otherdomain'
</code></pre>
<p>(I found gnome-keyring-query in the
<a href="http://www.gentoo-wiki.info/HOWTO_Use_gnome-keyring_to_store_SSH_passphrases">Gentoo Wiki</a>.)</p>
<p>Martti Rahkila has <a href="http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/~mara/mutt/profiles.html">more verbose article</a> with similar ideas.</p>

there were about 80 signatures that I couldn&rsquo;t verify because the corresponding

<p>There are 355 valid signatures. Thanks to all for such a huge participation,

Package: wnpp
</pre>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>the Debian Mutt package needs more maintainers.</p>
<p>There are almost 200 open bugs. Some of these are already forwarded
upstream and might just need some triaging/poking. Some need
forwarding. Some might be fixed with a trivial patch. Others are
Debian specific, mostly for the extra patches we include. There&rsquo;s
duplicates and sub-wishlist items. We are using bts-link to link to
dev.mutt.org&rsquo;s trac, but that also needs more tweaking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new upstream version 1.5.19 pending, we need people to check
which bugs still apply.</p>
<p>The (in?)famous mutt-patched package needs love to get the sidebar
patch updated to the new version, and to get some of mutt-ng&rsquo;s extra
gimmicks and add-ons integrated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved packaging to git since that seems to be the least scary
choice nowadays:</p>
<p><a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-mutt/mutt.git"><a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-mutt/mutt.git">http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-mutt/mutt.git</a></a></p>
<p>The repository has been updated to 1.5.19. The mutt-patched build is
disabled for now, as the patch doesn&rsquo;t apply. Testers welcome :)</p>
<p>If you are interested in helping out, please get in contact with me.
To get started, subscribe to mutt&rsquo;s PTS feed. There&rsquo;s no extra
maintainer mailinglist, mailing <a href="mailto:mutt@packages.debian.org">mutt@packages.debian.org</a> will work for
PTS subscribers. If you prefer IRC, join #mutt on irc.freenode.net.</p>
<p>Thanks, <br />
Christoph</p>

        Too much magic in Gentoo

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Five years after the release of patch 2.5.9, patch 2.6 was released two weeks
ago. The most interesting feature is that it will now produce reject files in
unified format when the input is in that format. Lucky for those of us whose
brain hurts when trying to read context diffs.</p>
<p>Of course there are more changes, and one of them is affecting Gentoo in particular:

<a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=293570">Gentoo bug #293570</a>
has attachments to reproduce the bug:</p>

drwxr-xr-x 3 cbe credativ 4096  2. Dez 12:23 tripwire-2.3.1-2-p1/
</pre>
<p>Note that it created a new tripwire-2.3.1-2-p1 directory inside the existing
one, which is consistent with -p0. The newly created file contain just the &ldquo;+&rdquo;
lines from the patch. (There are no &ldquo;-&rdquo; lines.) patch 2.5.9 would have refused
the patch because it couldn&rsquo;t find the file to patch.</p>
<p>This is arguably a surprising behavior, but what really happens here is that
-F3 (fuzz 3) will explicitly tell patch to ignore 3 context lines if it cannot
apply the patch otherwise. diff&rsquo;s default behavior is to create patches with 3
lines of context. patch&rsquo;s default fuzz factor is one less than that, 2. Now, 3</p>
<ul>
<li>3 is zero, which doesn&rsquo;t leave <i>any</i> context left.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently lots of Gentoo ebuilds use -F3, and try to guess the correct number
of directories to strip, starting with -p0, -p1, &hellip; No wonder that things
break badly for them now, as patches will suddenly succeed with -p0.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I like the new patch behavior, but in Gentoo&rsquo;s case I&rsquo;d say they
are using way too much magic in their build system, and now get bitten by
options they shouldn&rsquo;t have put there in the first place.</p>

      <p>I have a small set of config files and cfengine scripts that I want to deploy
on every machine I own. Of course, the Debian way is to put them into a package,
and install that. So far so good.</p>
<p>Problems arise when trying to maintain this package on several different $HOME
directories - depending on where I am when I want a change. Using $vcs (svn in
this case) works, but I&rsquo;d also like source packages. Only that I occasionally
forget where I put the repository. Or uploading new source packages is too
tedious.</p>
<p>The later problem was solved by a cute combination of dput and reprepro. My
.dput.cf has targets that rsync the package over to my server, and
automatically install the packages into the repository there.</p>
<p>For the repository problem, Stefano Zacchiroli&rsquo;s <em>debcheckout</em> comes to the
rescue. Vcs-Svn: in debian/control points to my svn+ssh:// repository. Instant
&ldquo;DWIM&rdquo; checkouts! (To actually make this work, the latest cfengine tweaks add
deb-src lines for my local repository that were previously missing.)</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There have been several long-term wishlist bugs on Mutt to include the
(in?)famous &ldquo;sidebar&rdquo; patch. It adds a panel on the left side of the screen to
list mailboxes with message counts.</p>
<img src="http://www.df7cb.de/projects/mutt/sidebar/mutt-sidebar.png">
<p>We do ship several patches with Debian&rsquo;s Mutt package that are not considered
for inclusion by the upstream authors, but this one is different. It touches
the core of the UI renderer and adds extensive counting of messages. There&rsquo;s
been quite a hype about the patch, it was even included in the (now
discontinued [1]) mutt-ng fork. Unfortunately, the patch was technically questionable, it
was written for the Mutt tarballs and didn&rsquo;t easily apply to CVS, and most
versions floating around contained lots of cruft like backup files and
temporary editor files. Furthermore, it is far from bug-free and even segfaults
occasionally.</p>
<p>Some months ago we decided we would build a second binary package to put the
patch in so we don&rsquo;t destabilize the standard package. Thanks Dann Frazier, we
got a clean patch, Adeodato had the right idea on how to build two binaries
from the same, differently-patched source (make install would run havoc, the
trick was to build the patched version <em>before</em> the regular one), and I
resolved some more involved conflicts with the maildir-mtime patch.</p>
<p>So, finally, there it is:
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/mutt-patched">mutt-patched</a>.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> As said, there <em>are</em> bugs. YMMV.</p>
<p>On related news, there&rsquo;s now also a -dbg package now for the victims of the
IMAP and header cache segfaults that we still see sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The sidebar patch was not the reason for the creation of mutt-ng,
but many mutt-ng users were using it because of this patch.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2008-01-08:</strong> [1] mutt-ng used to be a Mutt fork. It is now maintained
as a patch collection for Mutt.</p>

      <p>Soon after <a href="http://bzed.de/">Bernd Zeimetz</a> joined our company, he
infected me with the <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">geocaching</a> virus.
In the meantime, I bought a GPS receiver, and am now endeavoring around the
town and the nearby woods, searching for caches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that much free GPS and/or geocaching software around. gpsd works
quite well, but I don&rsquo;t take my computer to the woods ;) Viking is very nice
for visualizing waypoints and sorting them in categories, but is still
somewhere between alpha and beta state. gpsbabel reads and writes a zillion
different file format and talks to a vast array of receivers, but often needs
several attempts to upload data to mine. Things are moving fast though and
the GPS community looks active.</p>
<p>Last week I started looking into
<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and already added a few
roads in my neighborhood. Compared to commercial maps, there&rsquo;s still much to
do, especially for smaller tracks and features like foot bridges or woods
outside bigger cities. I&rsquo;ll keep collecting GPS data :) For the free software
side, neither OSM&rsquo;s online editor worked here (flash), nor the recommended tool
for local use (java), so I tried
<a href="http://www.irule.be/bvh/c++/merkaartor/">merkaartor</a> (qt4) which
works nicely. It also has some bugs, but feels very usable (though sometimes
slow). Starting from upstream&rsquo;s debian/ dir, building packages was
straightforward, and after some more editing, packages are now in unstable.
(The svn repository is in collab-maint, contributors welcome.)</p>

      <p>In contrast to chess, there is very little free software for bridge players.
Some <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/deal">deal</a>
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/dealer">generators</a> have been around
for years, but basically, that was all.</p>
<p>Nowadays major online bridge site is
<a href="http://online.bridgebase.com/">bridgebase.com</a>. Their windows
client actually runs quite well in cedega (and wine), with the notable
exception that the built-in double dummy solver doesn&rsquo;t work there.
(A double dummy solver is a program that computes the optimal line of play
with all four hands open (both sides dummy), and hence can compute the
theoretically optimal score for a given board.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, viewing records of played boards is a bit tedious as launching the
viewer of course requires wine as well. Editing boards is not possible. This is
where I started writing some perl scripts that would at least dump the board
records as text files. At the same time I thought about doing something
interesting with Gnome&rsquo;s glade UI builder. Over the past two years, I have been
working on a GTK+ version of a bridge hand viewer and editor I called
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/tenace/"><em>tenace</em></a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://web.telia.com/~u07502278/">Bo Haglund</a> released his
double dummy solver library as GPL software, I
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/libdds-dev">packaged</a> it for Debian
and worked on integration into tenace. It will compute &ldquo;best&rdquo; cards to play,
determine par scores.</p>
<p>Now tenace should be stable enough so I can risk announcing it to the world.</p>
<img src="http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/tenace/img/tenace-0.6.png">
<p>Coincidentally, the screenshot shows a board from last week&rsquo;s club
championships. East can beat 3NT by returning a Spade, but at my table they
didn&rsquo;t and so the board became my first squeeze hand :)</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve given the idea of centrally configuring my hosts another go. Previously I
had some meta packages that would pull in packages, but that&rsquo;s not very
interesting. Furthermore the archive I set up didn&rsquo;t scale, dpkg-scanpackages
plus makefiles aren&rsquo;t really fun to use.</p>
<p>Now, I have a set of cfengine scripts that gets distributed as .deb. That
sounds messy, but connecting reprepro with the right .dput.cf makes updating a
breeze.</p>
<p>cfengine itself is a beast not easily tamed. It has some weird ideas about
timeouts and when (not) to execute scripts. So far I&rsquo;m only using &ldquo;editfiles&rdquo;
in this setup to do tweaks like comment HashKnownHosts in ssh_config, add some
sources.list entries, add %adm to sudoers, etc. Next step will be to also

        DebConf: Flights booked
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I just booked my Debconf flights. Airline websites are a major PITA.
Germanwings wasn&rsquo;t even available, &ldquo;maintenance today from 23 to 2h&rdquo; - sorry,
no happy customer.</p>
<p>Ryanair&rsquo;s appearance was the worst. I don&rsquo;t mind crappy html as long as it
works, but why do I have to choice between &ldquo;Herr&rdquo; (Mr), &ldquo;Frau&rdquo; (Mrs), &ldquo;Mrs&rdquo;
(!), and &ldquo;Miss&rdquo;? When I said I lived in &ldquo;Mönchengladbach&rdquo; they replied with the
equivalent of &ldquo;Please do not use special characters like { } | &lt; &gt; [ ].&rdquo;
Apparently I&rsquo;m allowed some amount (&ldquo;20kg 15kg for travel past November 2006&rdquo;)
of luggage (except if I&rsquo;m below the age of 2), but later they charge for it.
Then there&rsquo;s a drop-down menu asking me in I which country live, but it doesn&rsquo;t
really mention that this is really where I select whether I want travel
insurance (I don&rsquo;t). At the end of the page I&rsquo;m asked to confirm that I accept
the travel insurance terms (I still don&rsquo;t), but that&rsquo;s also the checkbox for
their general terms of service. That flight would have gone through Prestwick
(PIK) which is apparently fairly well connected to Edinburgh, but the flight
back would leave at 7.50 am. I don&rsquo;t think I like that.</p>
<p>In parallel, I tried easyjet.com. They fly from Dortmund, and while looking
where that airport is, I first tried &ldquo;airport lounges&rdquo; which was obviously the
wrong place. A bit more hidden was a list of airports, but it didn&rsquo;t include
Dortmund. Google for the rescue&hellip; Then they tell me &ldquo;your total amount is
99,71€&rdquo;, only to additionally add 7,50€ on the next page just because I&rsquo;m using
a credit card - who doesn&rsquo;t? Of course I&rsquo;m willing to fill out personal
information like my address etc, but why do they want my phone number and email
address? And why do they claim &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t entered a phone number&rdquo; when I put
it (rather a fake one) in the &ldquo;mobile phone&rdquo; field (below &ldquo;home&rdquo;)? What really
drove me crazy was when they refused to accept the booking when I left the &ldquo;we
like to find out about our customers [&hellip;] reason for your trip&rdquo; field empty.
That&rsquo;s a drop-down menu with the choices &ldquo;Business&rdquo;, &ldquo;Visiting friends or
family and staying with them&rdquo;, &ldquo;Holiday&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Visiting friends or family but
staying elsewhere&rdquo;. No, I&rsquo;m not going to tell them. (I randomly selected
&ldquo;Business&rdquo;.) In the end, I booked there, but it wasn&rsquo;t really fun.</p>
<p>Whatever. Meet you at Debconf :)</p>
<p>[Update] Oh, and I had to confirm I &ldquo;have read, understood, and accept
easyJet&rsquo;s terms and conditions, including the new rules for hold baggage&rdquo;.
Thats a minimum of 10kB legal blurb - a simple &ldquo;accept&rdquo; checkbox would have
been enough&hellip;</p>

<p>In other words, there are about 18 people who have added a a UID, but not sent
it to a keyserver. One key wasn&rsquo;t even there. This includes a fair number of
people whom I usually trust to handle such things more carefully. Please
consider running gpg &ndash;send :)</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> On a closer look, at least one of the &ldquo;new user IDs&rdquo; was already
present on subkeys.pgp.net. Maybe my gpg was just to stupid to handle its own

meantime.)</p>

        Looking for a Window Manager
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I had been using fvwm2 for some 10 years when around the beginning of this
year, I thought it might be time for a change. My config was originally copied
from some SuSE templates and then heavily tweaked over the years, but recently
broke more and more in subtle way with new fvwm upstream versions, e.g. moving
windows suddenly required a different mouse button. Probably the config was
just slightly out of spec and fvwm got &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, but it was annoying.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;tiled&rdquo; window managers I had seen on others&rsquo; desktops made me curious, so
I gave ion3 a try some months ago. The overall appearance was all cool, but it
tried a bit too hard to squeeze all windows into tiled windows - of course
there&rsquo;s the floating workspace, but creating one was weird, and moving windows
even weirder. And if only the (default) key bindings were more vi-like&hellip; I
admit I never really bothered to read the documentation - probably everything
would have been much nicer otherwise.</p>
<p>Then there was the big license &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; with ion, at which point I started looking
around further. dwm looks clearly too l33t to be serious, so wmii was the next
choice, 3.1 to be exact. vi key bindings, a nicely configurable status bar, easy
workspace switching and window moving. wmii doesn&rsquo;t have horizontally split
windows (windows are always in columns), and no &ldquo;tabbed&rdquo; windows, though. It
didn&rsquo;t warp the pointer to the currently active window (something I got used to
with fvwm), but some config tweaks mostly fixed that. This time, I read the
documentation, but there&rsquo;s only a 10 page pdf beginners document, but there&rsquo;s
not much to configure anyway.</p>
<p>Then came lenny. Testing and unstable currently feature version 3.6 which is a
big disappointment. It is broken (the default config is unusable), and even
after fixing that, it looks like they removed all the little details that I
liked. The status bar is still there (though with a new location in the virtual
filesystem), the color cannot be changed anymore (unless changing some other
color as well). The windows used to have slim 1-pixel (configurable) borders.
Now they still have, but the border will be expanded if the window chooses a
different size - xterm always rounds down to the next character size, so all my
terminals have fat surroundings now. The last-active window in a inactive
column still had some markup so I knew which window Alt-Left/Right wound return
to, now I have to guess. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind fixing my 3.1 config for 3.6, but I
don&rsquo;t think I will, given these issues look unfixable. The 3.1 wmiirc file
looked like a sh script, the 3.6 uses eval and a bunch of functions that
frighten me. On a positive note, it is now possible to create new workspaces by
just selecting them, which is much handier than start-program, wait,
move-window-over, move-workspace.</p>
<p>I guess I will give ion (2, 3?) another try&hellip;</p>

      <p>To also announce it here, I&rsquo;ve moved to Mönchengladbach to work at
<a href="http://www.credativ.de/">credativ</a>, along with several other DDs,
Postgresql, and other open source folks. So far work has been pretty cool, and
I&rsquo;m fairly sure it will stay that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been mostly inactive lately because I didn&rsquo;t have internet access at home
yet. In fact, I officially still don&rsquo;t, but my provider is so &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to let me
connect to the DSL line, login in, and then tell me via http that
username/password were wrong. But, at this point, port 53/udp is open :)
Ganneff was so kind to set up an openvpn gateway for me and forward 22/tcp to
my server, so I can ssh, and tunnel everything else I like via that.</p>
<p>Sorry to my NMs for any delays lately, I hope to catch up this week.</p>
<p>On a different note, I&rsquo;m playing with ikiwiki and converting my blog, so please
excuse if that causes flooding on planet.debian.org (which I of course hope to

        New Printer: HL-2030
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I finally decided I needed a printer at home. Of course it had to be a laser.
When asked about Linux compatibility, the guys at the local store said
&ldquo;uhmmm&hellip; Brother&hellip; maybe&rdquo;. They pointed me at some printer on special offer,
a Brother HL-2030 for 110€. Naturally the box didn&rsquo;t say anything about
Linux, but I was promised I could return it if it didn&rsquo;t work (unless I
unpacked the toner cartridge, whatever).</p>
<p> Back at home, I just had to install cupsys, cupsys-client, foomatic-db-engine
and foomatic-db (using etch), fetch the HL-2060 (sic) ppd from
linuxprinting.org, do some clicks in the CUPS web interface and everything
worked out of the box. Setting the resolution to 1200x600 gave weird results
though, so I'm doing with 600x600 now.

        OpenPGP keys in DNS
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The latest addition to the mutt CVS tree is PKA support via gpgme. While trying
to figure out how that works in mutt (I haven&rsquo;t yet&hellip;) I configured my DNS
server for PKA and CERT records.</p>
<h2>PKA</h2>
<p>PKA (public key association) puts a pointer where to obtain a key into a TXT
record. At the same time that can be used to verify that a key belongs to a
mail address. The documentation is at the
<a href="http://www.g10code.de/docs/pka-intro.de.pdf">g10code website</a>
(only in German so far). I put the following into the df7cb.de zone:</p>
<p>
cb._pka IN TXT "v=pka1;fpr=D224C8B07E63A6946DA32E07C5AF774A58510B5A;uri=finger:cb@df7cb.de"
<pre>
$ host -t TXT cb._pka.df7cb.de
cb._pka.df7cb.de descriptive text "v=pka1\;fpr=D224C8B07E63A6946DA32E07C5AF774A58510B5A\;uri=finger:cb@df7cb.de"
</pre>
<p>Now gpg can be told to use PKA to find the key:</p>
<pre>
$ echo foo | gpg --auto-key-locate pka --recipient cb@df7cb.de --encrypt -a
gpg: no keyserver known (use option --keyserver)
gpg: requesting key 58510B5A from finger:cb@df7cb.de
gpg: key 58510B5A: public key "Christoph Berg <cb@df7cb.de>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: automatically retrieved `cb@df7cb.de' via PKA
</pre>
<h2>CERT</h2>
<p>CERT records work similarly. Records are generated by make-dns-cert (from the
tools directory in the gnupg source). cb.gpg is a stripped-down gpg keyring
(created with pgp-clean -s and converting from .asc to .gpg).</p>
<pre>
$ ./make-dns-cert -f D224C8B07E63A6946DA32E07C5AF774A58510B5A -n cb
cb      TYPE37  \# 26 0006 0000 00 14 D224C8B07E63A6946DA32E07C5AF774A58510B5A
$ ./make-dns-cert -k cb.gpg -n cb
cb      TYPE37  \# 1338 0003 0000 00 9901A20440 [...] 509C96D4BFF17B7
</pre>
<p>With a new bind and host (backports.org!) the format looks a bit nicer, that&rsquo;s
also what I copied into the zone file:</p>
<pre>
$ host -t CERT cb.df7cb.de
;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.
cb.df7cb.de has CERT record PGP 0 0 mQGiBECBGdAR [...] UDlCcltS/8Xtw==
cb.df7cb.de has CERT record 6 0 0 FNIkyLB+Y6aUbaMuB8Wvd0pYUQta
</pre>
<p>Again, gpg can be told to use that:</p>
<pre>
$ echo foo | gpg --auto-key-locate cert --recipient cb@df7cb.de --encrypt -a
gpg: key 58510B5A: public key "Christoph Berg <cb@df7cb.de>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: automatically retrieved `cb@df7cb.de' via DNS CERT
</pre>
<p>Thanks to weasel for some hints on using CERT.</p>
<h2>SSHFP</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m also mentioning SSHFP records here since it fits in the topic - I have been
using them for some months now:</p>
<pre>
$ host -t SSHFP tesla.df7cb.de
tesla.df7cb.de has SSHFP record 1 1 EE49B803541293656C33B86ECD781BD8F1D78AB5
tesla.df7cb.de has SSHFP record 2 1 3E82FB5EE8AA0205305F0D0186F94D6FB3E0E744
$ ssh -o 'VerifyHostKeyDNS yes' tesla.df7cb.de
The authenticity of host 'tesla.df7cb.de (88.198.227.218)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 5a:c9:38:ca:c0:2b:11:c1:c8:fb:f1:ad:73:a1:9c:8b.
Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</pre>
<p>The records are generated with ssh-keygen -r.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I just finished implementing
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/projects/postpone/">postpone</a>, a wrapper that
is intended to take an arbitrary command, fork into the background, wait until
some lockfile is freed, and then run the command. Of course the idea is that
the lockfile is /var/lib/dpkg/lock, and that postpone is used in maintainer
scripts. (Update-menus already does that, and I&rsquo;ve basically grabbed that code
and generalized it as a separate program.)</p>
<p>As a test implementation, I <a href="http://www.df7cb.de/projects/postpone/texlive/">modified
the post{inst,rm} templates in the tex-common package</a> and rebuilt
texlive-lang-* using that. dpkg -i texlive-lang-*.deb takes over 4 minutes in
the old version, but only a total of 60s with postpone used (35s for dpkg -i
plus 25s for the background jobs).</p>
<p>A Debian package is currently sitting in NEW, let&rsquo;s hope it will actually get
used in maintainer scripts.</p>

        The DM GR
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I haven&rsquo;t said anything in the DM threads yet because I still don&rsquo;t
know which actual problem the introduction of DMs is trying to solve.</p>
<p>IMHO the current process with sponsors reviewing and uploading
packages has proven to work nicely, i.e. the amount of broken packages
uploaded is not too high. Most of the perceived problems with this
process stem from the fact that most of the packages offered on
debian-mentors or #debian-mentors are initially crap and need lots of
review cycles. Once people produce good packages asking the last
sponsor for another upload should work. (And at that point NM will be
a breeze.)</p>
<p>Particularly I don&rsquo;t like the fact that the &ldquo;initial policy for an
individual to be included in the keyring&rdquo; does not include any check
of any technical or non-technical skills besides having a gpg key and
be able to tick 3 checkboxes. I fear this will lead to people
blacklisting &ldquo;DM&rdquo; packages because they don&rsquo;t want low-quality
packages on their machines.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rest of the GR text is micro-managing every
other detail of the process in a way that doesn&rsquo;t leave much room for
practical implementation decisions.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the DM concept as sketched in the GR is mainly
meant to let NMs upload earlier, i.e. it tries to fix the fact that
front-desk or DAM approval take too long. I think the fix for that is
just to find someone besides Joerg to also read the AM reports. DMs as
in the GR are a workaround, not a solution.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, I&rsquo;m still wondering why front-desk (and afaict the
DAMs) were never asked about their opinion while/after the GR was
drafted. I had some chats with Anthony on IRC on the topic, but that
was shortly after Debconf 6 (there was a related BoF), nothing in the
past months.</p>
<p>(not with the front-desk hat on, but having it within reach)</p>
<p>PS: I voted &ldquo;-1&rdquo;.</p>

        Becoming an early riser
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>At the beginning of this year, becoming an early riser was a
<a href="http://planet-search.steve.org.uk/cgi-bin/planet-search?terms=early+riser&submit=Search">recurrent theme on planet.debian.org</a>.
At the same time, the urge to put some order in my messy sleeping pattern had
grown, so I was very happy to read Steve Pavlina&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">blog posting</a>
on that. Before, I would usually stay up until very late (3am), being
over-tired, and then sleep 9 or even 10 hours, sometimes still being tired the
next day. The advice Steve gives is very simple: <i>Go to bed only when you&rsquo;re
too sleepy to stay up, and get up at a fixed time every morning.</i></p>
<p>
This sounded exactly like what I wanted. Now, I'm still rather the night owl
type, so I didn't pick something like 5am as Steve did, but a friendlier 9am.
The first 2 or 3 days were somehow hard, but I soon realized how healthier the
new rhythm was. I was getting up at the same time every day, including
weekends, and go to bed around 1.30am. The downside was that 2..3am (CET) is
often the best time on IRC and also very nice for hacking, but the additional
time gained in the morning was well worth it.
<p>
The hard part is to actually notice when you are tired. For me, it works best
to read a book, and then go to sleep when I can't concentrate on reading any
more. The difficulty for us computer people is that staying in front of the
screen somehow makes you unaware of how tired you actually are - just turn the
machine off and do something else (doh!). In the morning, it's important to
actually get up, since the body will adjust to the additional time in bed. What
I'm doing is to put the radio's timer at 9am, and the alarm clock at 9.05, so I
don't have to jump out of bed. Many times, I would wake up myself just at that
time.
<p>
Of course, when going out late, I don't get up at 9, but try to get back to the
rhythm immediately. Also, Debconf had thrown me out for some weeks, but luckily
I managed to get back in.

<p> The reason I'm blogging about that in the "debian" section is that it felt
very much like DebConf - lots of weird just-like-you people. We played about
two tournaments per day, always using different scoring methods or other ways
to make up pairs of players - we were not supposed to play with the same
partner twice, though Frederic, my flatmate, and I were casted together for a
second time in a young-plays-with-old tourney. In this sport, you are a junior
until well past 30, and he was just above the cut of 35 of this event. We also
bribed the good fairy to let Eva and me play together in the final masterpoint
tourney. We didn't score especially well since we were quite tired, but hey :*
<p> The site is an old castle, now operated by a German Scouts organization.
Somehow, the castle operates in a different time zone, breakfast was served at
12am, lunch at 7pm, and dinner at 11pm. DebConf should consider adopting that
:) It would also be interesting to see if we could have a "performance" at the
end, and who would run for Miss and Mister DebConf...
<p> The pictures I took are in
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0607-Rieneck/">my gallery</a>.
Sadly I didn't take a picture of the coffee tally list where one guy made
<em>two</em> ticks in the "flatrate" column 8-)
<p> <small>[*] beware, this is ugly html</small>
<p> <em>Update:</em> Next year's bridge camp will be from July 26th to August
5th - please pick a disjoint range for DebConf...

      <p>The flight to Mexico last Saturday went pretty much all ok, except that the
plane had to start through at MEX because of some unexpected wind and the
generally low air pressure at high altitudes. While this delayed the landing
for about 20 minutes, I had the opportunity for a second look at this
incredibly large city. After getting through customs, we (with Herman, Tore,
and Annabelle) met Neil McGovern in the airport lounge, and after Marcella and
Luciano had arrived, we had a rather bumpy ride to Oaxtepec, amounting to a 20h
journey for me.</p>
<p> The site here is really beautiful, with lots of green, palms, other plants,
and of the swimming pool. However, so far Debcamp has been rather unproductive,
we haven't had net access until Monday evening, and even yesterday round trip
times and packet loss were so high that neither ssh (IRC!) nor scp/ftp/http
were really usable. Using irssi's proxy module allowed me to get rid of the lag
locally for IRC, but the connection was still unstable. I wrote some patches
which I have yet to submit and replied to most of my NM mail, but the next
projects will all require access to the BTS and debian.org machines to be
worked on. At the moment, network is down again because the antenna connecting
us from the village fell down. The main activity for me so far has ben to play
Mao with Jesus, Adeodato, Marga, Graham, Gerfried, and others :-)
<p> Todo: get some real work done; upload pictures; go to the pool.
<p> Ah... network just went up again, yet still slow... mail queue flushed...
network down again...

      <p>After getting back from DebConf and the 1-week trip afterwards, it took me a
full week to get out of most of the chaos travelling usually leaves behind. I
still haven&rsquo;t unpacked all stuff from the suitcase, but at least managed to
wash the dirty clothes. Oh, and I&rsquo;ve signed all keys from the KSP - including
madduck&rsquo;s, he showed me his proper German ID card when I asked what this funny
Transnational Republic was. (Oh, and if you were listed at the KSP, didn&rsquo;t show
up, but I&rsquo;ve signed your key anyway, that&rsquo;s because we met before and you have
a new UID, in case you are wondering.) The pictures I took are still scatered
over several home dirs on different hosts, I&rsquo;ll try to sort/rotate/rename them
over the next days. (Oh, and DebConf was great, the trip afterwards likewise -
I&rsquo;ll try to write a separate blog post on that later&hellip;)</p>
<p>
At the moment I'm slowly starting to get into frontdesk work. I have some notes
from Neil's and Enrico's AM BoF and the discussion BoF round around my
"<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2006/05/msg00015.html">NM process future</a>"
proposal that I still have to write down once I'm finished with answering my
own NMs' mails. Both BoFs went pretty well, the major outcome being that we
should discuss much more among AMs on -newmaint and IRC, have older AM reports
available for reference by other AMs, and have some sort of "AM report template"
that lists the points the DAMs want to see in the report. About the propsal, my
feeling is that we shouldn't implement any major NM changes (like the DM idea)
until we really understand what the problem with the current process is. (It
takes too long, but that can be fixed by throwing out the not-ready applicants
more aggressively.) Thanks to all the people who provided very valuable
feedback during the BoFs and in the private conversations afterwards.
<p>
So far, I've assigned a few applicants to AMs, added comments to the database on
the level of prior contribution of the new applicants, and worked a bit on the
web pages. The major visible change is that the
<a href="https://nm.debian.org/nmgraph.php">NM graphs</a> are now included on
nm.d.o. The 'big' thing I'd like to implement next is to let the applicants
write some application email where they list what they've done for Debian so
far before the AM assignment, so we can match NM-AM better, and also improve
our judgement of the level of prior contribution. Also, we will probably
require 2 advocates per applicant in the future, to make sure people have
worked with more than a single DD before. Of course, all this must not get
excessive, we don't want to make joining Debian harder than it already is.
<p>
Then there's also the usual 2k+ message backlog waiting in the Debian mailbox...

      <p>Over the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve implemented some new features in
<a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php">DDPO</a>. The system, originally
written by Igor Genibel, is a mix of Python, Perl, and PHP generated from WML,
so it&rsquo;s quite interesting to see how these languages interact.</p>
<p>
The main new features are the ability to add arbitrary packages to the list
displayed, and an automatic listing of all NMUs and sponsored uploads in the
new "uploads" section. (Thanks to Ryan Murray, Joerg Jaspert, and Joey Schulze
for helping fix the projectb for that!) I won't repeat the details here, read
the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00015.html">d-d-a

<a href="http://people.debian.org/~igloo/popcon-graphs/index.php">Ian Lynagh's
popcon graphs</a> which I had mostly ignored so far.

Have a look at my <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=myon">DDPO

<p>In the meantime, I'm upgrading my old alpha box that suffered from random
memory failures when I tried last. It looks like disassembling the case and
cleaning all contacts helped. The harddisk is only 500MB, so I probably won't
be able to upgrade to XFree 4 and Firefox, not to mention that it's still
running a 2.2 kernel from 1999. It's still a nice ssh terminal, maybe also for
XDMCP.
<p>While writing this, some visitors are dropping in, but still not that much
that we wouldn't have time for reducing mail backlog and IRCing.

time to spend on other stuff. Today&rsquo;s good news was that <a

      <p>When my brother and I arrived at the LinuxTag site on Tuesday evening, the
booth was already half way set up and they were waiting for the remaining parts
to arrive. Most had already had dinner, so those few who hadn&rsquo;t yet left for
Gigi&rsquo;s restaurant (who can be said to be a Debian fan, since he remembers the
&ldquo;swirl&rdquo; guys from last year). When we returned, the vitrine was set up too :-)</p>
<p>
During the last Debian events, we had always maintained a tick list for "when
will Sarge arrive?" questions. Fact was, that this was also the most common
question on Wednesday, since the DVDs created for the LinuxTag didn't arrive
like promised and we had to tell people to come back later.
<p>
Today was Debian Day I with talks by Joey on Debian security, Luk on i18n/l10n,
Goswin on the Debian archive structure, Martin on volatile, Meike on debian-women, and Enrico on custom
Debian distributions. Most of the talks were quite nice to hear and well
organised. I took some pictures of the booth and the talks. (Sorry, not yet
renamed/rotated/pruned.)

Alexander Schmehl won an
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050623-LinuxTag/56.html">Etch prerelease</a>&rdquo;.
Later during the night, for what was declared the official German Sarge release
party, Martin Zobel-Helas and Alexander Schmehl had prepared a
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050623-LinuxTag/75.html">Debian quiz</a>
show. People from the audience were &ldquo;elected&rdquo; to answer questions ranging from
&ldquo;bring sarge/slink/hamm/rex in the right order&rdquo; to &ldquo;how many signatures does
Peter Palfrader have on his primary key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
This morning, I took the level 101 LPI exam. The questions were mostly simple
("name a command that lists all PCI devices"), but some were outdated (USB on
Linux 2.2) or wrong (the command "export set DISPLAY=:0.1" does not really make
sense). The results will only be available in a few weeks, but I'm sure I
passed even without any training before.

Next thing to happen: the social event.

      <p>The remaining parts of my NM process went through surprisingly well. Marc had
only a few points that I needed to clarify. He (HE) found some minor bugs in my
debian/rules files and a missing copyright attribution that I fixed this
evening. My application is now waiting for front desk approval. Thanks Marc for
being such a responsive AM!</p>
<p>Afterwards, I went over the NM templates from alioth's CVS and corrected some
stuff that I had spotted while I was answering the questions. The patch is mostly
reformatting and grammar fixes, but got quite big:

      <p>I&rsquo;ve updated my <a href="http://www.df7cb.de/debian/nm-graph/">NM graphs</a>.
There were some cases where the advocate and AM entries in the NM database
didn&rsquo;t match the Debian user name, so some people appeared with two different
names. There are still lots of unconnected components in the advocate graph,
which is because the &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; field in the NM database was added only later,
and the older entries all have &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; as advocate which I skip when
generating the graphs. If you want your advocate listed, or have advocated
someone back then, please tell me so I can add that to my scripts.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.grep.be/blog/2005/03/07#christoph_berg_nm_graphs">Wouter</a>
mentioned that besides <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/graphviz">neato</a>
there was <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/springgraph">springgraph</a>
to create this type of graph. Coincidentally, I happened to adopt that package
last week and as upstream hasn't updated it for some years, I'm probably also
its new upstream. However, I haven't managed yet to produce any useful output
on the NM graphs with it yet (it's still chewing on advocate.dot while I'm
writing this), so I'll stick to neato for the time being. (Since graphviz is
now free, I don't have any qualms against doing so.)
<p>
On a sidenote, I'm wondering how many software patents I'm touching with these
scripts in our fine <a href="http://ue.eu.int/">banana republic</a>.

Description: randomize lines of input text
 rl is a command-line tool that reads lines from an input file or stdin,
 randomizes the lines and outputs a specified number of lines. It does this
 with only a single pass over the input while trying to use as little memory
 as possible.
 .
 Currently randomize-lines is under development and command-line arguments
 may change slightly until a 1.0 release is made.

      <p>The social event on Friday night was nice - this year, the queue in front of
the buffet wasn&rsquo;t 50m long. At one of the sillier moments we took pictures for
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050624-LinuxTag/36-Hot_Alfie_0_percent.html">Hot Alfie</a>

The main event on Saturday was the
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0506-LinuxTag/050625-LinuxTag/03-Keysigningparty.html">keysigning party</a>.
Peter tried a little variation of the usual "all line up" scheme by
initializing it with participants 70 to 1 on the right side and 71 to 154 on
the left. Surprisingly, everyone found their place quite fast and we were
finished in some 80min. <a href="http://pgp-tools.alioth.debian.org/">caff</a>
seems to be a real success this year, I've already received signatures from
some 20 people using it. <a href="http://cabot.alioth.debian.org/">cabot</a> is
still used used by some. I found most other systems either hard to handle
(requiring me to sign a challenge several times per key or send mail "from" a
uid) or broken (someone claimed one of my keys was signing-only which isn't
true). caff cannot yet handle multiple keys in batch, so I will probably
implement that before having to sign every key twice.
<p>
We started dismantling the booth around 5pm, which caused a last-minute rush
for the Debian T-shirts. Apparently, we sold the coolest on the whole fair :-)
Back at home at 9pm, I was quite exhausted, but managed to rename all pictures
and remove some of the less interesting. If I got some names wrong or omitted
some, please tell me.
<p>
Overall, Saturday saw more "end users" at the booth compared to the days
before, but certainly less than 2004. I don't know how many visitors managed to
get one of the free "eticket" invitations, but the default 15&euro; per day
certainly kept some away. If this trend continues, and a good part of the
LinuxTag staff is quitting as rumors say, maybe there won't be a LinuxTag
2006 - which would really be sad.
