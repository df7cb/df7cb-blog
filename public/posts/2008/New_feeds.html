I&rsquo;ve updated bridgeblogging.com&rsquo;s URL and added about a dozen links to their

&ldquo;human&rdquo; blogs too much.
On real-life bridge notes, I played my first German nationals last weekend. We
finished 61st out of 94 pairs with 47.65% - could have been better, but given
the number of tricks I wasted with bad defense, I&rsquo;m not really unhappy. Smirnov

Piekarek won the first two sets by a comfortable margin, but 60.1% in the
third set weren&rsquo;t enough as Elinescu - Wladow scored 73.1% there and finished
first with 66.05%.

As 90 boards in two days aren&rsquo;t enough, we spent Sunday evening with another 32
boards to finish this year&rsquo;s round of league games. Our team did win all
matches (this one 19:11 VP), but we are still only second in the overall
scores.">
