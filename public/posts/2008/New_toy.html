    <meta name="description" content="Soon after Bernd Zeimetz joined our company, he
infected me with the geocaching virus.
In the meantime, I bought a GPS receiver, and am now endeavoring around the
town and the nearby woods, searching for caches.
There&rsquo;s not that much free GPS and/or geocaching software around. gpsd works
quite well, but I don&rsquo;t take my computer to the woods ;) Viking is very nice
for visualizing waypoints and sorting them in categories, but is still
somewhere between alpha and beta state. gpsbabel reads and writes a zillion
different file format and talks to a vast array of receivers, but often needs
several attempts to upload data to mine. Things are moving fast though and
the GPS community looks active.
Last week I started looking into
OpenStreetMap and already added a few
roads in my neighborhood. Compared to commercial maps, there&rsquo;s still much to
do, especially for smaller tracks and features like foot bridges or woods
outside bigger cities. I&rsquo;ll keep collecting GPS data :) For the free software
side, neither OSM&rsquo;s online editor worked here (flash), nor the recommended tool
for local use (java), so I tried
merkaartor (qt4) which
works nicely. It also has some bugs, but feels very usable (though sometimes
slow). Starting from upstream&rsquo;s debian/ dir, building packages was
straightforward, and after some more editing, packages are now in unstable.
