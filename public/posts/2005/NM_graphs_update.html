    <meta name="description" content="I&rsquo;ve updated my NM graphs.
There were some cases where the advocate and AM entries in the NM database
didn&rsquo;t match the Debian user name, so some people appeared with two different
names. There are still lots of unconnected components in the advocate graph,
which is because the &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; field in the NM database was added only later,
and the older entries all have &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; as advocate which I skip when
generating the graphs. If you want your advocate listed, or have advocated
someone back then, please tell me so I can add that to my scripts.

Wouter
mentioned that besides neato
there was springgraph
to create this type of graph. Coincidentally, I happened to adopt that package
last week and as upstream hasn&#39;t updated it for some years, I&#39;m probably also
its new upstream. However, I haven&#39;t managed yet to produce any useful output
on the NM graphs with it yet (it&#39;s still chewing on advocate.dot while I&#39;m
writing this), so I&#39;ll stick to neato for the time being. (Since graphviz is
now free, I don&#39;t have any qualms against doing so.)

On a sidenote, I&#39;m wondering how many software patents I&#39;m touching with these
scripts in our fine banana republic.">
