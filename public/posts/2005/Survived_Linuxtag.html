    <meta name="description" content="The social event on Friday night was nice - this year, the queue in front of
the buffet wasn&rsquo;t 50m long. At one of the sillier moments we took pictures for
Hot Alfie
and
Hot enrico
(ITPs to be submitted X-).

The main event on Saturday was the
keysigning party.
Peter tried a little variation of the usual &#34;all line up&#34; scheme by
initializing it with participants 70 to 1 on the right side and 71 to 154 on
the left. Surprisingly, everyone found their place quite fast and we were
finished in some 80min. caff
seems to be a real success this year, I&#39;ve already received signatures from
some 20 people using it. cabot is
still used used by some. I found most other systems either hard to handle
(requiring me to sign a challenge several times per key or send mail &#34;from&#34; a
uid) or broken (someone claimed one of my keys was signing-only which isn&#39;t
true). caff cannot yet handle multiple keys in batch, so I will probably
implement that before having to sign every key twice.

We started dismantling the booth around 5pm, which caused a last-minute rush
for the Debian T-shirts. Apparently, we sold the coolest on the whole fair :-)
Back at home at 9pm, I was quite exhausted, but managed to rename all pictures
and remove some of the less interesting. If I got some names wrong or omitted
some, please tell me.

Overall, Saturday saw more &#34;end users&#34; at the booth compared to the days
before, but certainly less than 2004. I don&#39;t know how many visitors managed to
get one of the free &#34;eticket&#34; invitations, but the default 15&euro; per day
certainly kept some away. If this trend continues, and a good part of the
LinuxTag staff is quitting as rumors say, maybe there won&#39;t be a LinuxTag
2006 - which would really be sad.
