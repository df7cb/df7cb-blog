    <meta name="description" content="Yesterday evening saw the KALUG party which resulted in quite a lot of
funny
pictures
of
Debian
folks.
Alexander Schmehl won an
&ldquo;Etch prerelease&rdquo;.
Later during the night, for what was declared the official German Sarge release
party, Martin Zobel-Helas and Alexander Schmehl had prepared a
Debian quiz
show. People from the audience were &ldquo;elected&rdquo; to answer questions ranging from
&ldquo;bring sarge/slink/hamm/rex in the right order&rdquo; to &ldquo;how many signatures does
Peter Palfrader have on his primary key?&rdquo;

This morning, I took the level 101 LPI exam. The questions were mostly simple
(&#34;name a command that lists all PCI devices&#34;), but some were outdated (USB on
Linux 2.2) or wrong (the command &#34;export set DISPLAY=:0.1&#34; does not really make
sense). The results will only be available in a few weeks, but I&#39;m sure I
passed even without any training before.

Next thing to happen: the social event.
