    <meta name="description" content="Random list of things that happened:

the day before, Werner Koch gave a talk on GnuPG
gpg --list-keys has a short equivalent (gpg -k), it&#39;s just not documented
I became an AM
I got my first applicant
entering an &#34;appointment&#34; in my new mobile phone does not make it
 ring at that time. Use &#34;alarm&#34; if you want to get woken up.
thanks to weasel, most of us now have fancy black light LED thingies
 that we will use to really check IDs at keysigning-parties
I uploaded a new signing-party release and at the same time, XTaran filed a new bug
we discussed lots of stuff: 
 
 ways of improving the PTS
 ways of improving the NM process
 ways of maintaining orphaned packages (which actually turned out
 to be &#34;how can we make sponsoring easier&#34;)
 what the QA group can to for security
 how not to release
 
barbecue, tea, beer
keysigning
I uploaded a package for XTaran and at the same time, djpig filed a new RC bug on it
lack of sleep
meeting lots of nice people

Photos to come.

[Update 23:42 CET] Photos are online.
