Subject: Bug#512072: RFH: mutt -- text-based mailreader supporting MIME, GPG, PGP and threading

Package: wnpp

Hi,
the Debian Mutt package needs more maintainers.
There are almost 200 open bugs. Some of these are already forwarded
upstream and might just need some triaging/poking. Some need
forwarding. Some might be fixed with a trivial patch. Others are
Debian specific, mostly for the extra patches we include. There&rsquo;s
duplicates and sub-wishlist items. We are using bts-link to link to
dev.mutt.org&rsquo;s trac, but that also needs more tweaking.
There&rsquo;s a new upstream version 1.5.19 pending, we need people to check
which bugs still apply.
The (in?)famous mutt-patched package needs love to get the sidebar
patch updated to the new version, and to get some of mutt-ng&rsquo;s extra
gimmicks and add-ons integrated.
I&rsquo;ve moved packaging to git since that seems to be the least scary
choice nowadays:
http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-mutt/mutt.git
The repository has been updated to 1.5.19. The mutt-patched build is
disabled for now, as the patch doesn&rsquo;t apply. Testers welcome :)
If you are interested in helping out, please get in contact with me.
To get started, subscribe to mutt&rsquo;s PTS feed. There&rsquo;s no extra
maintainer mailinglist, mailing mutt@packages.debian.org will work for
PTS subscribers. If you prefer IRC, join #mutt on irc.freenode.net.
Thanks, 
Christoph">
