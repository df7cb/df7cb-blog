    <meta name="description" content="I just finished packing up the signature collection for dedication-5.0.txt.
Hopefully I didn&rsquo;t miss any signatures, saving about 400 attachments is
tedious. Fortunately most people got the filenames right. On the down side,
there were about 80 signatures that I couldn&rsquo;t verify because the corresponding
key could not be found on the key servers. I&rsquo;ve mailed the owners, and about 20
have uploaded their key until now.
There are 355 valid signatures. Thanks to all for such a huge participation,
that&rsquo;s about twice the number (185) we got for dedicating Potato to Espy in
2000. (These were DD-only, though.)
Comparing to the various Debian keyrings, 207 active DDs participated, 3 former
DDs, 12 Debian maintainers, and 133 other contributors.
Let&rsquo;s hope Lenny will be as great as Thiemo would have liked it.">
