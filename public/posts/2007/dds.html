    <meta name="description" content="In January I discovered Bo Haglund&rsquo;s double dummy solver, called
DDS. I had been looking for an
open source solver running on Linux ever since I started playing Bridge, so
this was a very nice finding. It is very fast and the API is nicely documented.
 Of course, there are
Debian packages, one for
the (static) library (libdds-dev), for the ddd driver frontend (renamed to dds
as there&#39;s already some other package called ddd), and for the python extension
(python-pydds).
 I am working on a GTK2 frontend called
tenace. So far it features a
basic hand editor, can play cards, and compute double dummy/par scores. The
.lin import/export is not yet complete, but basically works.">
