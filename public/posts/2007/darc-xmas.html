    <meta name="description" content="For years, the Xmas contest has virtually been my only ham radio activity. This
year, after I had to take down the antenna in my parents&rsquo; yard, I put up the
40m part of a 80/40m dipole in the attic of my flat in Saarbrücken. The first
tests were satisfying so I drove back to Saarbrücken for December 26th.

The contest started nice with a S9&#43;50 signal from DR5S - of course DOK Q10
meant it was just very close. Unfortunately, things turned out much worse. The
antenna wasn&#39;t as matched as I had hoped and I had to put my small MFJ tuner
in. But, whatever I would tune to, the 1:1 would only withstand some second of
transmission and I had to retune. The 1:1 there would pop back up, and I had to
retune back to the original settings. GOTO 10.

After a bit more than one hour I gave up. The final log is here:

I don&#39;t know where the fault was, in the TRX, the tuner, or the antenna. I hope
it is not the TRX.">
