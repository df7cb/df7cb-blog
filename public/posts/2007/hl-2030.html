When asked about Linux compatibility, the guys at the local store said
&ldquo;uhmmm&hellip; Brother&hellip; maybe&rdquo;. They pointed me at some printer on special offer,
a Brother HL-2030 for 110€. Naturally the box didn&rsquo;t say anything about
Linux, but I was promised I could return it if it didn&rsquo;t work (unless I
unpacked the toner cartridge, whatever).
 Back at home, I just had to install cupsys, cupsys-client, foomatic-db-engine
and foomatic-db (using etch), fetch the HL-2060 (sic) ppd from
linuxprinting.org, do some clicks in the CUPS web interface and everything
worked out of the box. Setting the resolution to 1200x600 gave weird results
though, so I&#39;m doing with 600x600 now.">
