    <meta name="description" content="The flight to Mexico last Saturday went pretty much all ok, except that the
plane had to start through at MEX because of some unexpected wind and the
generally low air pressure at high altitudes. While this delayed the landing
for about 20 minutes, I had the opportunity for a second look at this
incredibly large city. After getting through customs, we (with Herman, Tore,
and Annabelle) met Neil McGovern in the airport lounge, and after Marcella and
Luciano had arrived, we had a rather bumpy ride to Oaxtepec, amounting to a 20h
journey for me.
 The site here is really beautiful, with lots of green, palms, other plants,
and of the swimming pool. However, so far Debcamp has been rather unproductive,
we haven&#39;t had net access until Monday evening, and even yesterday round trip
times and packet loss were so high that neither ssh (IRC!) nor scp/ftp/http
were really usable. Using irssi&#39;s proxy module allowed me to get rid of the lag
locally for IRC, but the connection was still unstable. I wrote some patches
which I have yet to submit and replied to most of my NM mail, but the next
projects will all require access to the BTS and debian.org machines to be
worked on. At the moment, network is down again because the antenna connecting
us from the village fell down. The main activity for me so far has ben to play
Mao with Jesus, Adeodato, Marga, Graham, Gerfried, and others :-)
 Todo: get some real work done; upload pictures; go to the pool.
 Ah... network just went up again, yet still slow... mail queue flushed...
network down again...">
