    <title>Junior Bridge Camp in Rieneck | Myon&#39;s Blog</title>

    <meta name="description" content="I spent the first 12 days of August at the German Junior Bridge camp[*] in
Rieneck.
 The reason I&#39;m blogging about that in the &#34;debian&#34; section is that it felt
very much like DebConf - lots of weird just-like-you people. We played about
two tournaments per day, always using different scoring methods or other ways
to make up pairs of players - we were not supposed to play with the same
partner twice, though Frederic, my flatmate, and I were casted together for a
second time in a young-plays-with-old tourney. In this sport, you are a junior
until well past 30, and he was just above the cut of 35 of this event. We also
bribed the good fairy to let Eva and me play together in the final masterpoint
tourney. We didn&#39;t score especially well since we were quite tired, but hey :*
 The site is an old castle, now operated by a German Scouts organization.
Somehow, the castle operates in a different time zone, breakfast was served at
12am, lunch at 7pm, and dinner at 11pm. DebConf should consider adopting that
:) It would also be interesting to see if we could have a &#34;performance&#34; at the
end, and who would run for Miss and Mister DebConf...
 The pictures I took are in
my gallery.
Sadly I didn&#39;t take a picture of the coffee tally list where one guy made
two ticks in the &#34;flatrate&#34; column 8-)
 [*] beware, this is ugly html
 Update: Next year&#39;s bridge camp will be from July 26th to August
5th - please pick a disjoint range for DebConf...">
