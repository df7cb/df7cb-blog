        DebConf: Flights booked
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I just booked my Debconf flights. Airline websites are a major PITA.
Germanwings wasn&rsquo;t even available, &ldquo;maintenance today from 23 to 2h&rdquo; - sorry,
no happy customer.</p>
<p>Ryanair&rsquo;s appearance was the worst. I don&rsquo;t mind crappy html as long as it
works, but why do I have to choice between &ldquo;Herr&rdquo; (Mr), &ldquo;Frau&rdquo; (Mrs), &ldquo;Mrs&rdquo;
(!), and &ldquo;Miss&rdquo;? When I said I lived in &ldquo;Mönchengladbach&rdquo; they replied with the
equivalent of &ldquo;Please do not use special characters like { } | &lt; &gt; [ ].&rdquo;
Apparently I&rsquo;m allowed some amount (&ldquo;20kg 15kg for travel past November 2006&rdquo;)
of luggage (except if I&rsquo;m below the age of 2), but later they charge for it.
Then there&rsquo;s a drop-down menu asking me in I which country live, but it doesn&rsquo;t
really mention that this is really where I select whether I want travel
insurance (I don&rsquo;t). At the end of the page I&rsquo;m asked to confirm that I accept
the travel insurance terms (I still don&rsquo;t), but that&rsquo;s also the checkbox for
their general terms of service. That flight would have gone through Prestwick
(PIK) which is apparently fairly well connected to Edinburgh, but the flight
back would leave at 7.50 am. I don&rsquo;t think I like that.</p>
<p>In parallel, I tried easyjet.com. They fly from Dortmund, and while looking
where that airport is, I first tried &ldquo;airport lounges&rdquo; which was obviously the
wrong place. A bit more hidden was a list of airports, but it didn&rsquo;t include
Dortmund. Google for the rescue&hellip; Then they tell me &ldquo;your total amount is
99,71€&rdquo;, only to additionally add 7,50€ on the next page just because I&rsquo;m using
a credit card - who doesn&rsquo;t? Of course I&rsquo;m willing to fill out personal
information like my address etc, but why do they want my phone number and email
address? And why do they claim &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t entered a phone number&rdquo; when I put
it (rather a fake one) in the &ldquo;mobile phone&rdquo; field (below &ldquo;home&rdquo;)? What really
drove me crazy was when they refused to accept the booking when I left the &ldquo;we
like to find out about our customers [&hellip;] reason for your trip&rdquo; field empty.
That&rsquo;s a drop-down menu with the choices &ldquo;Business&rdquo;, &ldquo;Visiting friends or
family and staying with them&rdquo;, &ldquo;Holiday&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Visiting friends or family but
staying elsewhere&rdquo;. No, I&rsquo;m not going to tell them. (I randomly selected
&ldquo;Business&rdquo;.) In the end, I booked there, but it wasn&rsquo;t really fun.</p>
<p>Whatever. Meet you at Debconf :)</p>
<p>[Update] Oh, and I had to confirm I &ldquo;have read, understood, and accept
easyJet&rsquo;s terms and conditions, including the new rules for hold baggage&rdquo;.
Thats a minimum of 10kB legal blurb - a simple &ldquo;accept&rdquo; checkbox would have
been enough&hellip;</p>

looks like I will meet a lot of old and new friends in EDI.</p>

      <p>Although I missed the deadline for the DC7 KSP, I just imported the keyring.
First I ran gpgsigs -r ksp-dc7.txt, and then gpg &ndash;import ksp-dc7.asc.
The result is scary:</p>
<pre>
gpg: Total number processed: 182
gpg:               imported: 44  (RSA: 3)
gpg:              unchanged: 117
gpg:           new user IDs: 18
gpg:            new subkeys: 1
gpg:         new signatures: 64
</pre>
<p>In other words, there are about 18 people who have added a a UID, but not sent
it to a keyserver. One key wasn&rsquo;t even there. This includes a fair number of
people whom I usually trust to handle such things more carefully. Please
consider running gpg &ndash;send :)</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> On a closer look, at least one of the &ldquo;new user IDs&rdquo; was already
present on subkeys.pgp.net. Maybe my gpg was just to stupid to handle its own
keyrings. (The missing key was really not there, I&rsquo;ve uploaded it in the
meantime.)</p>

      <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.sixxs.net/">sixxs.net</a> I&rsquo;m now connected to

aiccu, only the openvpn routes for my other machines was a bit more tricky.
(Openvpn doesn&rsquo;t support &ldquo;mode server&rdquo; for ipv6 yet.)</p>
<p>On a sidenote, freewrt is much nicer to use on my Asus WL500gp than openwrt -
feels much more like Linux (even Debian) than the nvram stuff on openwrt.</p>

        Looking for a Window Manager
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I had been using fvwm2 for some 10 years when around the beginning of this
year, I thought it might be time for a change. My config was originally copied
from some SuSE templates and then heavily tweaked over the years, but recently
broke more and more in subtle way with new fvwm upstream versions, e.g. moving
windows suddenly required a different mouse button. Probably the config was
just slightly out of spec and fvwm got &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, but it was annoying.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;tiled&rdquo; window managers I had seen on others&rsquo; desktops made me curious, so
I gave ion3 a try some months ago. The overall appearance was all cool, but it
tried a bit too hard to squeeze all windows into tiled windows - of course
there&rsquo;s the floating workspace, but creating one was weird, and moving windows
even weirder. And if only the (default) key bindings were more vi-like&hellip; I
admit I never really bothered to read the documentation - probably everything
would have been much nicer otherwise.</p>
<p>Then there was the big license &ldquo;wtf&rdquo; with ion, at which point I started looking
around further. dwm looks clearly too l33t to be serious, so wmii was the next
choice, 3.1 to be exact. vi key bindings, a nicely configurable status bar, easy
workspace switching and window moving. wmii doesn&rsquo;t have horizontally split
windows (windows are always in columns), and no &ldquo;tabbed&rdquo; windows, though. It
didn&rsquo;t warp the pointer to the currently active window (something I got used to
with fvwm), but some config tweaks mostly fixed that. This time, I read the
documentation, but there&rsquo;s only a 10 page pdf beginners document, but there&rsquo;s
not much to configure anyway.</p>
<p>Then came lenny. Testing and unstable currently feature version 3.6 which is a
big disappointment. It is broken (the default config is unusable), and even
after fixing that, it looks like they removed all the little details that I
liked. The status bar is still there (though with a new location in the virtual
filesystem), the color cannot be changed anymore (unless changing some other
color as well). The windows used to have slim 1-pixel (configurable) borders.
Now they still have, but the border will be expanded if the window chooses a
different size - xterm always rounds down to the next character size, so all my
terminals have fat surroundings now. The last-active window in a inactive
column still had some markup so I knew which window Alt-Left/Right wound return
to, now I have to guess. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind fixing my 3.1 config for 3.6, but I
don&rsquo;t think I will, given these issues look unfixable. The 3.1 wmiirc file
looked like a sh script, the 3.6 uses eval and a bunch of functions that
frighten me. On a positive note, it is now possible to create new workspaces by
just selecting them, which is much handier than start-program, wait,
move-window-over, move-workspace.</p>
<p>I guess I will give ion (2, 3?) another try&hellip;</p>

      <p>To also announce it here, I&rsquo;ve moved to Mönchengladbach to work at
<a href="http://www.credativ.de/">credativ</a>, along with several other DDs,
Postgresql, and other open source folks. So far work has been pretty cool, and
I&rsquo;m fairly sure it will stay that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been mostly inactive lately because I didn&rsquo;t have internet access at home
yet. In fact, I officially still don&rsquo;t, but my provider is so &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to let me
connect to the DSL line, login in, and then tell me via http that
username/password were wrong. But, at this point, port 53/udp is open :)
Ganneff was so kind to set up an openvpn gateway for me and forward 22/tcp to
my server, so I can ssh, and tunnel everything else I like via that.</p>
<p>Sorry to my NMs for any delays lately, I hope to catch up this week.</p>
<p>On a different note, I&rsquo;m playing with ikiwiki and converting my blog, so please
excuse if that causes flooding on planet.debian.org (which I of course hope to
avoid by keeping the old timestamps, mmmv).</p>
