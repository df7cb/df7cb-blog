        Junior Bridge Camp in Rieneck
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I spent the first 12 days of August at the German <a
href="http://www.juniorbridge.de/">Junior Bridge camp</a><sup>[*]</sup> in
Rieneck.</p>
<p> The reason I'm blogging about that in the "debian" section is that it felt
very much like DebConf - lots of weird just-like-you people. We played about
two tournaments per day, always using different scoring methods or other ways
to make up pairs of players - we were not supposed to play with the same
partner twice, though Frederic, my flatmate, and I were casted together for a
second time in a young-plays-with-old tourney. In this sport, you are a junior
until well past 30, and he was just above the cut of 35 of this event. We also
bribed the good fairy to let Eva and me play together in the final masterpoint
tourney. We didn't score especially well since we were quite tired, but hey :*
<p> The site is an old castle, now operated by a German Scouts organization.
Somehow, the castle operates in a different time zone, breakfast was served at
12am, lunch at 7pm, and dinner at 11pm. DebConf should consider adopting that
:) It would also be interesting to see if we could have a "performance" at the
end, and who would run for Miss and Mister DebConf...
<p> The pictures I took are in
<a href="http://www.df7cb.de/pictures/0607-Rieneck/">my gallery</a>.
Sadly I didn't take a picture of the coffee tally list where one guy made
<em>two</em> ticks in the "flatrate" column 8-)
<p> <small>[*] beware, this is ugly html</small>
<p> <em>Update:</em> Next year's bridge camp will be from July 26th to August
5th - please pick a disjoint range for DebConf...

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The flight to Mexico last Saturday went pretty much all ok, except that the
plane had to start through at MEX because of some unexpected wind and the
generally low air pressure at high altitudes. While this delayed the landing
for about 20 minutes, I had the opportunity for a second look at this
incredibly large city. After getting through customs, we (with Herman, Tore,
and Annabelle) met Neil McGovern in the airport lounge, and after Marcella and
Luciano had arrived, we had a rather bumpy ride to Oaxtepec, amounting to a 20h
journey for me.</p>
<p> The site here is really beautiful, with lots of green, palms, other plants,
and of the swimming pool. However, so far Debcamp has been rather unproductive,
we haven't had net access until Monday evening, and even yesterday round trip
times and packet loss were so high that neither ssh (IRC!) nor scp/ftp/http
were really usable. Using irssi's proxy module allowed me to get rid of the lag
locally for IRC, but the connection was still unstable. I wrote some patches
which I have yet to submit and replied to most of my NM mail, but the next
projects will all require access to the BTS and debian.org machines to be
worked on. At the moment, network is down again because the antenna connecting
us from the village fell down. The main activity for me so far has ben to play
Mao with Jesus, Adeodato, Marga, Graham, Gerfried, and others :-)
<p> Todo: get some real work done; upload pictures; go to the pool.
<p> Ah... network just went up again, yet still slow... mail queue flushed...
network down again...

      <p>After getting back from DebConf and the 1-week trip afterwards, it took me a
full week to get out of most of the chaos travelling usually leaves behind. I
still haven&rsquo;t unpacked all stuff from the suitcase, but at least managed to
wash the dirty clothes. Oh, and I&rsquo;ve signed all keys from the KSP - including
madduck&rsquo;s, he showed me his proper German ID card when I asked what this funny
Transnational Republic was. (Oh, and if you were listed at the KSP, didn&rsquo;t show
up, but I&rsquo;ve signed your key anyway, that&rsquo;s because we met before and you have
a new UID, in case you are wondering.) The pictures I took are still scatered
over several home dirs on different hosts, I&rsquo;ll try to sort/rotate/rename them
over the next days. (Oh, and DebConf was great, the trip afterwards likewise -
I&rsquo;ll try to write a separate blog post on that later&hellip;)</p>
<p>
At the moment I'm slowly starting to get into frontdesk work. I have some notes
from Neil's and Enrico's AM BoF and the discussion BoF round around my
"<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2006/05/msg00015.html">NM process future</a>"
proposal that I still have to write down once I'm finished with answering my
own NMs' mails. Both BoFs went pretty well, the major outcome being that we
should discuss much more among AMs on -newmaint and IRC, have older AM reports
available for reference by other AMs, and have some sort of "AM report template"
that lists the points the DAMs want to see in the report. About the propsal, my
feeling is that we shouldn't implement any major NM changes (like the DM idea)
until we really understand what the problem with the current process is. (It
takes too long, but that can be fixed by throwing out the not-ready applicants
more aggressively.) Thanks to all the people who provided very valuable
feedback during the BoFs and in the private conversations afterwards.
<p>
So far, I've assigned a few applicants to AMs, added comments to the database on
the level of prior contribution of the new applicants, and worked a bit on the
web pages. The major visible change is that the
<a href="https://nm.debian.org/nmgraph.php">NM graphs</a> are now included on
nm.d.o. The 'big' thing I'd like to implement next is to let the applicants
write some application email where they list what they've done for Debian so
far before the AM assignment, so we can match NM-AM better, and also improve
our judgement of the level of prior contribution. Also, we will probably
require 2 advocates per applicant in the future, to make sure people have
worked with more than a single DD before. Of course, all this must not get
excessive, we don't want to make joining Debian harder than it already is.
<p>
Then there's also the usual 2k+ message backlog waiting in the Debian mailbox...

        Starting a Bridge blog
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I should have started this blog about a year ago or so just to have something
that documents my progress learning this fascinating game. I haven&rsquo;t decided
yet whether this should be in English or German. I guess it will be a mix with
English for the more general stuff and German for tournament results, schaun
mer mal :)</p>
<p> It all began in May 2004 with Sigi talking about Skat and Doppelkopf in his
dancing club, when a friend told him to try Bridge. He then joined a beginners
course and asked me to join. After the second session (too much Minibridge in
the first one ;-) I knew I loved the game. Together with a few others we (Sigi
and I) quickly went through a crash course in bidding and basic playing
techniques in a few weeks that would normally have lasted over a year. Thanks
Regine :-)
<p> I don't remember exactly when we played the first tournament in the club,
but it must have been something like August '04. Our goal was not to become
last one, and from memory, we exactly did that. The expectations quickly
raised, soon we scored around or above 50% most of the time. I won my first
club tournament in January '05 with Regine. A very nice result was in August
'05 when we scored 8th in a field of 91 pairs at a pub tournament in Koblenz
(Regine and Frederic were 1st).
<p> I guess since about 3/4 of a year I can really tell the difference between
MPs and IMPs. Having soon discovered BBO (I'm Myon there), and regularly
playing team events in Dudweiler, we learned to love IMPs and very much prefer
that scoring. We now playing for team 1 of the Saarbrücken 65 club together
with Klaus and Arno, and absolutely unexpectedly, have just won 72 out of 75
victory points at the first three matches in Frankfurt. We probably won't
benefit too much from that, though, since these three teams probably won't make
it into the final round, and the remaining two teams seem to be stronger.
Judging from the recent team results in the Dudweiler club, and the (few)
butler results in the Saarbrücken 84 club, we seem to be good at IMPs. Compare
that with the 32% MP result last week ;-)
<p> We are currently playing a <a href="http://www.df7cb.de/bridge/">5
Majors</a> system with a 15-17 NT, developed by Thomas Schmitt. He trusts us
enough that we edit the system script and will usually accept new stuff. We
were having a look at Moscito recently, but at the moment I don't feel like
going into bidding more, at the current level I'm at, declarer play is much
more important (you have to make the contracts you bid, after all...). Defense
also could be improved, though I should practise declarer play much more
judging from the hands that I could have made had I given more care to the
opponents' discards.
<p> Together with teams from Halle/Saale and <a
href="http://www.unibridge.de">BUM Mannheim</a>, we were playing team matches
on BBO in the past weeks, usually on Sundays. I'd like to have more teams join
us there, if you are interested, please subscribe to the <a
href="http://luithle.net/mailman/listinfo/bbo-team">bbo-team list</a>.
