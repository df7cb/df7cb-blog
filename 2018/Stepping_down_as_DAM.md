After quite some time (years actually) of inactivity as
<a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/organization#dam">Debian Account Manager</a>,
I finally decided to give back that Debian hat.
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/03/msg00001.html">I'm stepping down as DAM</a>.
I will still be around for the occasional comment from the peanut gallery, or
to provide input if anyone actually cares to ask me about the old times.

Thanks for the fish!
