<a href="http://adam.rosi-kessel.org/weblog/free_software/code/randomsort.html">Adam</a>: there's randomize-lines:
<pre>
Package: randomize-lines
Maintainer: Arthur de Jong <adejong@debian.org>
Description: randomize lines of input text
 rl is a command-line tool that reads lines from an input file or stdin,
 randomizes the lines and outputs a specified number of lines. It does this
 with only a single pass over the input while trying to use as little memory
 as possible.
 .
 Currently randomize-lines is under development and command-line arguments
 may change slightly until a 1.0 release is made.
