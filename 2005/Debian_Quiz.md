[[!meta title="Debian Quiz"]]

With the help of <a href="http://blog.schmehl.info/">Alexander Schmehl</a>
I've created a <a href="http://www.df7cb.de/debian/quiz/">Debian Quiz</a>.
Test your knowledge about Debian's distribution, people, mailing lists, etc.!

<p> PS: Alex, you could have as well told me the
<a href="http://blog.schmehl.info/2005/08/27#no-meme-WEP-keys">reason</a>
why I have to use a TP cable going to your router right now instead
of blogging it :-)
